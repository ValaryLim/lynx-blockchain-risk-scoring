From here, gold would need to get to ~$2002 for the ROR with gains+interest to equal what I'd get by simply holding USDC (8.6%; this is on the BlockFi platform). 

Interesting, but not exciting yet.

So to me me it’s a lower risk than smart contract risk on Ethereum, where the code is being updated and chance of introducing bugs is increased.

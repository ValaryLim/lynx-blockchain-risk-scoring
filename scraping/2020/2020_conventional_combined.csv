1269,2020-02-22 20:18:26,"California street shut down after 40,000 bees swarm from hotel","A swarm of as many as 40,000 Africanized bees sent several people to hospital and closed a street in California, after swarming from the eaves of a Howard Johnson Inn. Police and firefighters were called to the scene after a report about a bee sting on a boulevard in Pasadena on Wednesday evening. Two firefighters, two police officers and one civilian ended up at hospital after being stung. “Something set them off, some activity, noise, vibration … it’s hard to tell what,” Dave Williams of the Los Angeles County Beekeepers Association told local television station KTLA. “We have firefighters who have been working here for many, many years, and they said this is by far the most bees they’ve seen at one location,” a Pasadena fire department spokeswoman, Lisa Derderian, told the Los Angeles Times. Africanized bees are descended from a cross-breed between African and European bees that was introduced in South America in the 1950s but which escaped and proliferated, breeding with local species. Due to their habit of aggressively defending their nests, the insects have acquired an familiar nickname: killer bees.

Two firefighters, two police officers and one civilian ended up at hospital after being stung. “Something set them off, some activity, noise, vibration … it’s hard to tell what,” Dave Williams of the Los Angeles County Beekeepers Association told local television station KTLA. “We have firefighters who have been working here for many, many years, and they said this is by far the most bees they’ve seen at one location,” a Pasadena fire department spokeswoman, Lisa Derderian, told the Los Angeles Times. Africanized bees are descended from a cross-breed between African and European bees that was introduced in South America in the 1950s but which escaped and proliferated, breeding with local species. Due to their habit of aggressively defending their nests, the insects have acquired an familiar nickname: killer bees. In Pasadena, police and firefighters first tried to calm the bees with smoke, then used fire extinguishing foam to kill the bees after they failed to calm down. “We don’t like to kill bees, we’re beekeepers,” Williams told KTLA. “But in a situation like this, where the public safety is of concern, we have to take care of the public.”",FOAM,1,"['at', 'are', 'as', 'and', 'bee', 'care', 'fire', 'first', 'foam', 'for', 'in', 'like', 'one', 'set', 'sent', 'swarm', 'tell', 'who', 'up']",[Timestamp('2020-02-22 20:18:26')]
1270,2020-01-15 18:15:17,Nike shoes that have revolutionised marathon times unlikely to be banned,"The World Athletics working group investigating the Nike shoes which have revolutionised marathon times is still deliberating over what limits to place on the carbon plate and foam technology and is unlikely to implement a wholesale ban. The Guardian understands the group met again on Wednesday and intends to announce its findings by the end of the month. But sources suggest that, contrary to headlines about the shoes being banned, the issue remains under debate. As things stand, the group’s emphasis appears more on putting limits to the future incarnations of the technology, which was first introduced in 2016, rather than restricting the Vaporfly shoes completely. One option under consideration is to put limits on the size of the foam midsoles in all shoes, something that would make the next‑generation AlphaFly shoes worn by Eliud Kipchoge in his sub-two‑hour marathon run in Vienna illegal. Kipchoge insists that focusing on his Nike shoes is wrong. “They are fair,” he told the Telegraph. “I trained hard. Technology is growing and we can’t deny it – we must go with technology.” There have also been suggestions that similar shoe technology was used to power Laura Muir’s spikes on the track last year.

1309,2020-08-05 01:59:23,Ammonium nitrate: what is the chemical blamed for blast in Lebanese capital?,"The likely cause of the huge blast in Beirut on Tuesday appears to have been the highly reactive chemical ammonium nitrate. Lebanon’s prime minister, Hassan Diab, said 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate exploded after lying unsecured in a warehouse for six years, tallying with reports that a ship carrying a similar quantity of the chemical had unloaded its cargo at the port in 2013. It remains unclear what caused the chemical to ignite. Ammonium nitrate is a common industrial chemical used mainly for fertiliser because it is a good source of nitrogen for plants. It is also one of the main components in mining explosives. It is not used as an explosive on its own, rather it is an oxidiser and makes a fire more intense, according to Gabriel da Silva, a senior lecturer in chemical engineering at the University of Melbourne. However, da Silva said, it ignites only under the right circumstances, and these are difficult to achieve. “You need extreme circumstances to set off an explosion,” he said. While ammonium nitrate can in fact put out a fire, if the chemical itself is contaminated, for example with oil, it becomes highly explosive. “I think that’s what’s happened here,” said da Silva. While the chemicals in the air should dissipate fairly quickly, lingering pollutants can cause problems later, for example if they acidify rain. “If you look at the smoke that came from the blast it’s this kind of blood red colour. That’s because of the nitrogen oxide air pollutants in it,” he said. If the 2,700-tonne figure is accurate, that would make the ammonium nitrate explosion larger than the 1947 Texas City Disaster, when a consignment of 2,300 tonnes of ammonium nitrate exploded, killing nearly 500 people. The blast created a 4.5-metre (15ft) wave. The images coming out of Beirut are also horribly reminiscent of the destruction inflicted on the Chinese city of Tianjin by a 2015 warehouse disaster that killed more than 170 people and left hundreds injured. On the night of 12 August a series of cataclysmic detonations rocked an area of warehouses where large quantities of hazardous chemicals, also including sodium cyanide and potassium nitrate, were being stored, in some cases illegally. Chinese authorities later claimed the first explosion had been triggered when the summer heat caused a highly flammable compound called nitrocellulose to spontaneously ignite. Nearby stores of ammonium nitrate then caught fire and exploded in the major port city, which lies 110km (70 miles) south-east of the capital Beijing. Firefighters who rushed to the scene reportedly attempted to extinguish the initial blaze with water – only to inadvertently exacerbate the situation because of the presence of hazardous flammable chemicals. The majority of those killed were firefighters, including at least one teenager. Such was the force of the Tianjin explosions that they registered as small earthquakes. Then, as now, witnesses filmed apocalyptic, almost surreal footage showing the scale of the inferno. • This article was amended on 13 August 2020 to remove a reference to the 1947 Texas City explosion causing a “tidal” wave, and to clarify some of the properties of ammonium nitrate.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/05/ammonium-nitrate-what-is-the-chemical-blamed-for-blast-in-lebanese-capital,world/2020/aug/05/ammonium-nitrate-what-is-the-chemical-blamed-for-blast-in-lebanese-capital,"Ammonium nitrate: what is the chemical blamed for blast in Lebanese capital?

1310,2020-04-04 23:22:24,Belfast shooting: three men arrested,"Three men have been arrested in Belfast in connection with the murder of a man in the north of the city earlier on Saturday. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the three suspects were taken to Musgrave Street police station in central Belfast for questioning on Saturday evening. The PSNI also said that the murdered man was shot several times during the gun attack in the Ardoyne district around 11.50am on Saturday. A councillor whose constituency includes the Ardoyne district where the fatal shooting occurred said a number of children were playing nearby when the man was shot dead. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said there was no excuse for this “abhorrent and brutal crime”, adding that it was “particularly thoughtless at a time when our emergency services are already working increasingly hard to keep us all safe dealing with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic”. The victim was killed in the front garden of a house in Etna Drive in Ardoyne. Local sources said they did not believe the killing had a sectarian motive, and that the victim was not from the area. Paul McCusker, an SDLP councillor for north Belfast, said a number of people living in Etna Drive tried to save the victim after he was shot. “One man from Etna Drive tried to use CPR to revive him but to no avail while other neighbours in the street comforted him until the emergency services came,” he said. McCusker said it was deeply disturbing that young children playing in their front gardens while locked down at home due to the coronavirus crisis may have witnessed the shooting. “This brutal crime has caused immense shock in Ardoyne. My thoughts are with this man’s family at an incredibly difficult time. “I also think that this will compound the already massive pressure on people living here who are having problems coping with self-isolation and lockdown,” he said. Investigating officers had locked down large parts of the area surrounding the location of the shooting, he added, urging the public to cooperate with the police. A car believed to have been used in the killing was found on fire a short distance away in Ardoyne on Jamaica Street. Gerry Kelly, the Sinn Féin member of the legislative assembly for North Belfast, also condemned the shooting. “I would appeal for calm at this time in the area and stress that anybody with any information about this horrific incident should bring it immediately to the PSNI,” he said. “Actions like this have no place in our society and I repeat my condemnation of those involved. “At a time when all frontline statutory agencies and indeed communities are doing what they can to fight against Covid-19 this just adds to the suffering unfortunately being experienced by local people at this time.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/man-shot-dead-outside-north-belfast-house,uk-news/2020/apr/04/man-shot-dead-outside-north-belfast-house,"Belfast shooting: three men arrested Three men have been arrested in Belfast in connection with the murder of a man in the north of the city earlier on Saturday.

2151,2020-09-02 15:04:10,Whatever floats your boat? Scientists defy gravity with levitating liquid,"Scientists have turned the world upside down with a curious quirk of physics that allowed them to float toy boats the wrong way up beneath a levitating body of liquid. In a striking demonstration of the mind-bending effect, the boats seem to defy the laws of gravity as they bob about on the water above them with their sails pointing down. The bizarre phenomenon makes for a nifty trick, but researchers say the finding may have practical implications, from mineral processing to separating waste and pollutants from water and other liquids. “We were playing around,” said Emmanuel Fort, a researcher on the team that discovered the effect at the Higher School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry in Paris. “We had no idea it would work.” The scientists made their finding while studying the curious impact vibrations can have on the behaviour of liquids. Researchers already knew that, given the right kind of vibrations, bubbles can plunge downwards in liquids, while heavy particles that would normally settle out float to the surface instead. Another strange effect of vibrations allows a layer of liquid to float in air, provided it is in a closed container. The explanation lies in the ability of vibrations to stabilise what are otherwise unstable systems. If a container holding a runny liquid is swiftly flipped over, the liquid will fall to the bottom. The liquid does not fall in one go, however. Instead, droplets first form on the underside of the liquid, which instigate the rest of the liquid’s collapse. But set the container on a vibrating plate and the liquid can behave very differently. Vertical shaking at the right frequency prevents the droplets forming. Without them, the liquid remains aloft: instead of falling, it rests on the cushion of air. This much was already known. What Fort and his colleagues showed was that objects could experience an “antigravity” effect and float in the underside of the levitated liquid. Writing in Nature, they demonstrate this with small toy boats floating in levitating layers of glycerol and silicon oil. A number of forces keep the boats in place. The first comes from air pressure, which is raised by the weight of the liquid above, and pushes the boat up into the water. But the liquid pushes back on the boat itself, a force that decreases higher up the layer. Gravity also pulls the boat down. It all makes for a delicate balance that could fall apart at any moment, were it not for the vibrations. “If you move the boat down in the air it will fall, and if you move it up, it will go up to the interface. The whole trick is not only to make the situation possible in the first place, but to stabilise the equilibrium,” Fort said. The researchers believe the work opens up new avenues for study, and suspect the effect might be useful for industrial processes, such as removing plastic particles from liquids. But for now, the scientists are simply enjoying the weird effect. “The fun thing is that it triggers reactions from people who aren’t scientific,” Fort said. “People say it’s like the scene in Pirates of the Caribbean when the boat floats upside down. It’s counterintuitive. It gets people talking about science fiction and fantasy and that is very nice.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/sep/02/whatever-floats-your-boat-scientists-defy-gravity-with-levitating-liquid,science/2020/sep/02/whatever-floats-your-boat-scientists-defy-gravity-with-levitating-liquid,"Whatever floats your boat?

2152,2020-06-02 17:30:17,'The initial reaction was just joy': window therapy brings light to aged care residents,"Once a week, Benhur Helwend sanitises his ukulele, meticulously washes his hands and slaps on a cheery boater hat to prepare for a new kind of performance. The punters who’ll gather to hear him play are residents at an aged care home on Sydney’s north shore. And depending which way you look at it, either Helwend or his audience members are behind glass. This is window therapy – a way of engaging elderly people with the arts (and a good singalong) while physical distancing restrictions are in place. Musician and actor Benhur Helwend adds colour to the windows “Usually I start by drawing a big gigantic love heart on the window, and then I write ‘I miss you’,” Helwend says, outlining a new performance kit that includes liquid chalk markers as well as huge amounts of window cleaner. “The residents are in their common room and they are facing the window, and I’m on the other side with a microphone and a little PA. It’s very difficult for me to hear them, so a lot of it is very visual. I’ll draw the songs a bit like Pictionary, and they have to guess the tune we are about to sing.” Helwend is primarily a musician and actor (you might have seen him in ABC’s Les Norton last year), and laughs while describing his illustration powers as “really bad”. Still, he is slowly developing the ability to write backwards, and has started incorporating what he calls “Mr Squiggle” elements into the shows at Whiddon Hornsby: residents place their hands on the window, then he traces around and creates drawings from their handprints. But Helwend’s main point of connection is through song, and after three years of closeup visits to this facility – plus more than a decade at other aged care homes – he knows which tunes will get feet tapping, even at a distance. The Whiddon Hornsby crowd are big fans of Doris Day tunes, Helwend says. Alongside What a Wonderful World, You Are My Sunshine, and Aussie standards such as Waltzing Matilda and the Happy Little Vegemites jingle. The window therapy shows were, Helwend admits, “a bit shaky at first”. Uncertain of even leaving the house at the beginning of lockdown, he was also “terrified of potentially exposing a resident”. Even so, those early performances were “incredibly emotional”, he says. “The initial reaction was just joy. I would sing a song and, despite me not hearing their reactions, I could see them singing along or tapping their feet. They were connecting with the music … even just a finger tap or a toe tap is enough.” Staff, too, notice the difference. “Our residents love their creative engagement sessions with Benhur, and are thrilled that these can still take place during visitor restrictions – albeit through the window,” says the facility’s director of care services, Sally Martin. “It’s so important, particularly at this time, to keep their spirits up and keep them engaged through play and fun.” Now with six weeks of performances under his belt, Helwend says he finds great satisfaction in maintaining connections with his “elders” through a sheet of glass – and he’s not alone. Benhur Helwend beckons one of the residents to come to the window. Coronavirus restrictions have prompted the formation of the Outside In Collective (AKA “Boredom Force”), a loose coalition of creatives who work in aged care facilities, engaging residents with the arts. Founder Maurie Voisey-Barlin came up with the idea of window therapy and was quick to spread it around. Together, the collective is providing window therapy at 10 sites across New South Wales. For Helwend, the weekly bookings are meaningful work. “I feel like I’m contributing to the happiness of people in the last stage of their lives,” he says. And why is window therapy so important? The best answer is in the lyrics of one of his favourite songs, Hello in There by John Prine, Helwend says. “Old people just grow lonesome,” he sings. “Waiting for someone to say, ‘Hello in there, hello’.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/03/the-initial-reaction-was-just-joy-window-therapy-brings-light-to-aged-care-residents,lifeandstyle/2020/jun/03/the-initial-reaction-was-just-joy-window-therapy-brings-light-to-aged-care-residents,"'The initial reaction was just joy': window therapy brings light to aged care residents Once a week, Benhur Helwend sanitises his ukulele, meticulously washes his hands and slaps on a cheery boater hat to prepare for a new kind of performance.

The best answer is in the lyrics of one of his favourite songs, Hello in There by John Prine, Helwend says. “Old people just grow lonesome,” he sings. “Waiting for someone to say, ‘Hello in there, hello’.”",Liquid,1,"['at', 'are', 'as', 'and', 'work', 'best', 'huge', 'bit', 'can', 'care', 'day', 'for', 'good', 'grow', 'get', 'play', 'hat', 'in', 'into', 'kind', 'like', 'look', 'lot', 'one', 'music', 'now', 'new', 'guess', 'song', 'start', 'tap', 'who', 'up', 'way', 'well']",[Timestamp('2020-06-02 17:30:17')]

We have more time on our hands to pay attention to our skincare regimen, which is great. But here’s the thing: we are overmasking. Many people are applying masks every night thinking they are doing wonders for their skin. In fact, what they are doing is stripping the skin of its protective barrier and confusing the life out of it. (Ah, and there you were thinking the annoying breakouts and excess dullness were all down to lockdown.) Most masks are not created for daily use. Hydrating masks should be used only when you need one. Clay masks – great for detoxing – and acid-based masks, like this Oskia offering (concocted with 10% lactic acid), should be limited to twice a week. If your complexion looks dull and sluggish, you’ll love this. It’s a mask with a difference. It is liquid (don’t be tempted to use the entire bottle in one go, you don’t need much), it is an overnighter (you wear it to bed) and (unlike many of its counterparts) it actually works. Ingredients include brightening niacinamide, moisture-boosting hyaluronic acid and, of course, exfoliating lactic acid. Come morning, you will see a huge difference. On first use, build resistance by wearing for 10 minutes and wash off, because initially it can feel a bit tingly and itchy. You can then try again later in the week. But no more than that.

2154,2020-04-22 20:30:06,Weatherwatch: what is the dew point?,"The dew point is the temperature at which a certain area of air must be cooled to for dew to form. It is also commonly interpreted as a measure of the air’s moisture content. As air cools, the amount of the gaseous form of water it is capable of holding decreases, and as such, cooling will eventually result in it reaching saturation point, beyond which condensation into liquid water droplets occurs. This is the main process behind cloud formation in the atmosphere. Of course, dew can also form on surfaces on earth. When the surface (for example grass or cars) cools below the dew point temperature of the air adjacent, condensation droplets from the air deposit onto that surface. If surface temperatures fall below 0C and below the dew point temperature, instead of water vapour gas condensing to water droplets, it transitions directly to crystals of ice, in the form of frost. While frost formation in winter months is rather common, surface temperatures in autumn or in spring are less likely to fall down to the air’s dew point, aided by the shorter overnight cooling periods. Hence, dew and frost do not form as readily, especially on objects which can have larger stores of heat in them, such as roads.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/22/weatherwatch-what-is-the-dew-point,environment/2020/apr/22/weatherwatch-what-is-the-dew-point,"Weatherwatch: what is the dew point?

2155,2020-04-22 12:00:44,Kim-Joy's recipe for lemon and rose tofu cheesecake,"This cheesecake is made with tofu, which gives it a nice and creamy texture. It’s a great option if you have silken tofu in your cupboard, but are short on fresh ingredients such as cream. It tastes different to a standard cheesecake as it is less “cheesy”, but I enjoy both. You can always substitute some of the silken tofu for vegan or dairy cream cheese. I enjoy the simplicity of this version, which lets the lemon and rosewater flavours shine. The edible petal decorations are an optional extra and can be arranged however you like. Serves six to eight For the biscuit base 180g digestive biscuits (or use any sweet, plain biscuit) 80g melted dairy or vegan butter (or 70g melted coconut oil – if you use coconut oil it won’t look liquid enough to set firm in the fridge, but it will set firmer than the butter option after a couple of hours) Alternative biscuit base (vegan and gluten-free) 125g dates 125g blanched almonds (you can substitute other nuts and adjust quantities for desired sweetness) Pinch of salt 15g melted coconut oil (or melted vegan butter) For the cheesecake 675g silken tofu (or you can use cream cheese – vegan or dairy) 190g caster or granulated sugar 1½ tbsp cornflour ¼ tsp rosewater (optional) 1½ tbsp coconut oil (or use melted butter – vegan or dairy) Grated rind of two lemons (or any citrus fruit) For the petal decorations (optional) White edible wafer paper Food dyes: brown, pink, yellow Heat the oven to 180C/160C (fan)/350F. Place the biscuits in a sandwich bag and use a rolling pin to crush them into fine crumbs. Place in a bowl and pour over the melted butter/coconut oil. Stir together until the crumbs look evenly coated, and then press into the base of a 9in round ovenproof dish. Alternatively, you can make the vegan and gluten-free version. Place the dates in a food processor and blitz until they are sticky and form a ball. Add the blanched almonds, a pinch of salt and coconut oil, and blitz again until combined. Press this mixture into your dish. For the cheesecake, use a food processor to blend the tofu until smooth (or use cream cheese). Remove a couple of tablespoons and whisk this together with the cornflour in a separate bowl. Add back to the main mixture, along with the caster sugar, rosewater (optional), melted coconut oil and grated lemon rind. Mix together again until smooth and combined. Pour over the biscuit base, and then bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until slightly coloured at the edges and there is still a slight wobble in the centre. Cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge to finish cooling. Meanwhile, make the edible decorations. Cut simple petal shapes from the wafer paper, then use a paintbrush to very lightly wet these. Paint using food dye mixed with a little water. When the wafer paper is wet, you will be able to shape it so that it looks more realistic. For the stem make a long stem shape painted brown. When you’re happy with your petals and stem, leave to dry for a few hours. They will go hard and be easy to pick up.

2344,2020-05-17 05:30:03,Los Angeles explosion: 11 firefighters hurt as 'hash oil factory' burns,"An explosion in downtown Los Angeles has injured 11 firefighters, with scores more sent to put out the blaze in what was described as a factory making cannabis oil. Captain Erik Scott of the Los Angeles fire department said “one significant explosion” shook the neighborhood around 6.30pm on Saturday and as first responders arrived they saw firefighters emerge from the building with burns and other injuries. Some of their uniforms were on fire. Four firefighters were taken to a burns intensive care unit, two were put on ventilators due to signs of swelling airways and the other five who were hospitalized suffering a range of burns. The two firefighters on ventilators appeared to have inhaled superheated gases but as of around 10pm local time it seemed none of the injuries were life-threatening, said the fire department’s medical director, Marc Eckstein. Firefighters were initially called to 327 East Boyd Street in the city’s Toy District for a report of a fire at a one-storey commercial building. The LA fire department issued a “mayday” call, which means a firefighter is missing, down or trapped, and characterised the blaze as a “major emergency” with more than 230 firefighters responding. The fire spread to several nearby buildings but by 7.15pm appeared largely under control. When the firefighters first entered the building before the explosion they saw “light to moderate smoke”, but also noticed that the pressure and heat was increasing inside, said fire chief Ralph M Terrazas: “Things didn’t seem right.” The firefighters moved to evacuate at this point and as they were starting to exit, the “explosion or flash” occurred, prompting the mayday call, he said. Some of their coats caught fire. Scott described the business as a maker of “butane honey oil.” Butane is a flammable gas. Making the oil involves extracting the high-inducing chemical THC from cannabis plants to create a highly potent concentrate also known as hash oil. The oil is used in vape pens, edibles, waxes and other products. Small butane canisters were later found on the street, officials said. The business where the explosion erupted may have been a wholesale distributor but the nature of the operation and the cause of the fire were still under investigation late Saturday evening. “We have every expectation the firefighters will pull through,” Eckstein told reporters, noting that all firefighters were awake and alert upon arrival to the hospital. “It could’ve been much, much worse.” Eckstein said there were no Covid-19 patients in the unit where the firefighters were being treated but the hospital was taking precautions to protect them. Terrazas said the department was providing mental health services for the impacted first responders: “A lot of our firefighters were traumatized. You can imagine the amount of emotional stress.” Jeralyn Cleveland told the Los Angeles Times she was on a roof of an apartment building a few blocks away when she saw the explosion: “Everyone in my building thought there was a bomb that went off. It was like a mushroom.” The site of the fire was not far from Skid Row, a downtown LA neighborhood that is the epicenter of the city’s homelessness crisis.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/17/los-angeles-explosion-10-firefighters-injured-in-major-emergency,us-news/2020/may/17/los-angeles-explosion-10-firefighters-injured-in-major-emergency,"Los Angeles explosion: 11 firefighters hurt as 'hash oil factory' burns An explosion in downtown Los Angeles has injured 11 firefighters, with scores more sent to put out the blaze in what was described as a factory making cannabis oil. Captain Erik Scott of the Los Angeles fire department said “one significant explosion” shook the neighborhood around 6.30pm on Saturday and as first responders arrived they saw firefighters emerge from the building with burns and other injuries. Some of their uniforms were on fire. Four firefighters were taken to a burns intensive care unit, two were put on ventilators due to signs of swelling airways and the other five who were hospitalized suffering a range of burns. The two firefighters on ventilators appeared to have inhaled superheated gases but as of around 10pm local time it seemed none of the injuries were life-threatening, said the fire department’s medical director, Marc Eckstein. Firefighters were initially called to 327 East Boyd Street in the city’s Toy District for a report of a fire at a one-storey commercial building. The LA fire department issued a “mayday” call, which means a firefighter is missing, down or trapped, and characterised the blaze as a “major emergency” with more than 230 firefighters responding. The fire spread to several nearby buildings but by 7.15pm appeared largely under control. When the firefighters first entered the building before the explosion they saw “light to moderate smoke”, but also noticed that the pressure and heat was increasing inside, said fire chief Ralph M Terrazas: “Things didn’t seem right.” The firefighters moved to evacuate at this point and as they were starting to exit, the “explosion or flash” occurred, prompting the mayday call, he said. Some of their coats caught fire. Scott described the business as a maker of “butane honey oil.” Butane is a flammable gas. Making the oil involves extracting the high-inducing chemical THC from cannabis plants to create a highly potent concentrate also known as hash oil. The oil is used in vape pens, edibles, waxes and other products. Small butane canisters were later found on the street, officials said. The business where the explosion erupted may have been a wholesale distributor but the nature of the operation and the cause of the fire were still under investigation late Saturday evening. “We have every expectation the firefighters will pull through,” Eckstein told reporters, noting that all firefighters were awake and alert upon arrival to the hospital. “It could’ve been much, much worse.” Eckstein said there were no Covid-19 patients in the unit where the firefighters were being treated but the hospital was taking precautions to protect them. Terrazas said the department was providing mental health services for the impacted first responders: “A lot of our firefighters were traumatized. You can imagine the amount of emotional stress.” Jeralyn Cleveland told the Los Angeles Times she was on a roof of an apartment building a few blocks away when she saw the explosion: “Everyone in my building thought there was a bomb that went off.

2509,2020-04-19 11:00:36,The best wines to drink during lockdown,"Strange the things you learn at a time when a trip to the bins is what passes for a night on the tiles. Stuck inside with too much time on my hands, I’ve discovered that nettles make better soup than damply greasy chips; that rice ground up in the coffee grinder is a perfectly adequate replacement for flour; and that the dregs of an old jar of sumac bring just the right edge of earthy bitterness and scarlet tint to a homemade, non-alcoholic Campari-esque cordial (made with the juice and zest of two oranges boiled down with a cup apiece of sugar and water). More seriously, I’ve realised that times of anxious confinement lend themselves only to very moderate wine consumption – no more than a glass a day – and that each daily glass should provide the maximum comfort for the money. By comfort, I mean flavours and textures that are soothing in themselves, whether that’s because they trigger distracting happy memories of a place or time, or because there’s something intrinsically consoling in the way they’re put together. Everyone will have their own idea of a comfort wine, but over the past few weeks I’ve found myself increasingly drawn to red and white styles that share certain sensual qualities: mouthfilling richness, directness of flavour, and a suave smoothness. In whites, that means ripe chardonnay (wines taking their cue from Mâcon in southern Burgundy or the warmer spots of California rather than the leanly citrussy style perfected in northerly Chablis); the fruit of Alsace pinot gris and blanc and its New World imitators, from New Zealand to Oregon and Chile; the unashamedly fat palate and alluring apricot-and-honeysuckle scents of wines made from the viognier variety; the orchard-in-autumn-scented South African chenin-blanc-based blend. In reds, the blueprint is the sun-baked blend of grenache, syrah and mourvedre perfected in the southern Rhône valley, but available in different shades and more or less brambly-fruited, peppery or garrigue herby variations across the Mediterranean, in California, South Africa and the great old vineyards of Barossa and the Eden Valley in Australia. But I’ve found cosiness, too, in the chocolatey notes and soothing velvety-texture of Argentinian malbec, the vivid blackcurrant pastille softness of Chilean cabernet sauvignon, and the savoury mellowness of rioja – simple pleasures for complicated times. Cave de Hunawihr Kuhlmann-Platz Pinot Blanc Alsace, France 2017 (£9.99, as part of mix six, Majestic) Just a touch of sugar adds to the feeling of ripe juicy greengage, melon and peach in this gently mouthfilling pinot blanc, with a ripple of racy acidity and white flowers bringing a spring-like feel. Co-op Irresistible Viognier IGP Pays d’Oc, France 2018 (£8, The Co-op) A textbook example of viognier from the versatile winemaker Jean-Claude Mas, with all the variety’s alluring apricot and honeysuckle aromas and a ripe, full, but not at all overbearing palate. Viñalba Malbec Mendoza, Argentina 2017 (£8, Morrisons) One of Argentina’s most reliable winemaking labels, Viñalba produces excellent malbec in both southern Patagonia and, as here, in the Andean Uco Valley in Mendoza: rich, velvety, dark-berried and rewarding. D’Arenberg The Olive Grove Chardonnay McLaren Vale, Australia 2018 (from £9.95, ndjohn.co.uk; Tesco) Beautifully judged modern Australian chardonnay that offers waves of luminous ripe golden apple and restrained nutty oak, with the necessary balancing lively acidity to work with creamy pasta dishes. Errazuriz Estate Cabernet Sauvignon Maipo Valley, Chile 2018 (£9.49, Waitrose) Many of us who came of wine-drinking age in the 1990s and 2000s will have a soothing nostalgic soft spot for the crème de cassis, mint and smooth richness of Chilean cabernets, such as this beautifully judged example. Taste the Difference Saint-Chinian Languedoc, France 2017 (£9, Sainsbury’s) Syrah plays the main part in a blend with grenache in this classic southern French red blend, which has notes of liquorice, dark brambly berry fruit and pepper, and matches so well with equally comforting roasts and stews.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/19/the-best-wines-to-drink-during-lockdown,food/2020/apr/19/the-best-wines-to-drink-during-lockdown,"The best wines to drink during lockdown Strange the things you learn at a time when a trip to the bins is what passes for a night on the tiles.

2912,2020-07-23 09:09:32,Church of Sweden's female priests outnumber men – but are paid less,"Sixty years after the first female priests were ordained in the Church of Sweden, they now outnumber men – but only just. “From a historical perspective, this parity happened faster than we earlier imagined,” said Cristina Grenholm, the secretary for the Church of Sweden, as the former state church announced that 50.1% of its priests are female. A report in 1990 had estimated that women would not make up half the total clergy until 2090. But, despite reaching the milestone, female pastors are still paid less than men. The wage gap averages 2,200 Swedish kronor (£196) per month, according to the church’s newspaper, Kyrkans Tidning. Grenholm said this was due to more men being in more senior positions. The Church of Sweden has allowed female priests since 1958 and first ordained three women in 1960. In 1982, Swedish legislators scrapped a “conscience clause” allowing members of the clergy to refuse to cooperate with a female colleague. Now, many parishes have both a man and a woman presiding over Sunday services, said Grenholm. “Since we believe that God created human beings, both men and women, in God’s image, it is essential that we do not only speak about it, but that it is also shown.” In 2017, the church urged clergy to use gender-neutral language, saying God was “beyond our gender determinations”. The church is the largest Lutheran denomination in Europe, with more than 6 million members in a population of 10 million. But membership, particularly among young Swedes, has sharply declined in recent years. It separated from the state 20 years ago. One in three active priests in the Church of England is female, although 51% of deacons ordained last year were women.

2913,2020-04-21 11:45:02,Your starter for 10: where are all the women on University Challenge?,"Judging by the gender balance, you could be forgiven for thinking that this year’s University Challenge grand final had taken place sometime in the 1970s. There wasn’t a single woman on screen for the entire 30 minutes. This is not to detract from the achievement of the winners. The triumph of Imperial college in this week’s final was pleasing – it’s always pleasing to see an Oxbridge college brought down a peg or two – and the breadth of knowledge displayed was incredibly impressive. But we cannot be expected to believe that there wasn’t a single female student at Imperial or Corpus Christi who could have added to those teams. I didn’t do badly playing along at home, answering a number of questions correctly where the contestants on screen did not, and I am very far from being exceptional. Perhaps had a woman been present she would have known the names of the other female winners of the Prix Goncourt – Leïla Slimani and Marguerite Duras – as well as that of Simone de Beauvoir. The gender balance on University Challenge is a longstanding issue that has been highlighted in the past by Mary Beard and Gloria De Piero, among others (the 2014 series was a staggering 84% male, while this year, of 28 teams, only five were equally gender-balanced). It is one which, to the show’s credit, it has tried to address. In 2018 it agreed to more “gender-neutral” questions . Was this behind this final’s round on fashion designers, I wonder? Perhaps the question writers were inspired by the scene in which Bridget Jones, having been baffled by the questions at a Law Society dinner, some of which are in Latin, succeeds in identifying the designers of Princess Diana’s wedding dress. That pledge was two years ago, and these days the questions don’t seem to be the problem so much as the recruitment process, which is handled by the universities themselves, and which was brilliantly satirised in the form of Benedict Cumberbatch’s anal retentive “floating renaissance man” team captain in the film adaptation of Starter for 10. I suspect the problem with this is twofold: students are almost certainly not working hard enough to recruit women and make their teams inclusive, but also women themselves may not be as keen to appear on television, for a number of reasons. Earlier this year, former contestant Lucy Clarke wrote in the Observer of the misogynistic abuse she received on social media after appearing on the show. Can anyone really blame women for wanting to swerve comments from dirty old men speculating as to whether a young student many years his junior “sucks like a Dyson”? I know experienced female journalists who avoid appearing on TV for the same reason. To expect women barely out of their teens to put up with this is a big ask. As Clarke pointed out, quizzing has long been accepted as male. “The teams are selected by the students themselves and I think most of them would jump at the chance to have a girl on the team, but not many apply,” former contestant Sophie, who was part of the 2010 St Andrews team, tells me. “I don’t know why that is. If it’s a confidence thing, then that would be a shame. But I think that the subset of people who love memorising random facts, remembering them under time pressure, and, honestly, showing off about their general knowledge, tends to skew fairly male and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.” There’s that saying, “you can’t be what you can’t see,” and I do wonder if University Challenge’s reputation as a male-dominated show means that many women can’t envisage themselves taking part. “It never occurred to me that I’d get into the team,” says Sophie. “When an email went round mentioning the tryouts, I thought my boyfriend would be good at it. So I said I’d go to the tryouts if he did. And then I got on the team and he didn’t.” For as long as women continue to face abuse, underestimate themselves or be under the impression that quiz shows are not for them, University Challenge will continue to be male dominated, which is why, for the next series, it should give gender-balanced quotas a try. It would not only reflect the fact that most students in the UK are now female, but it would normalise gender parity and inspire the female contestants of the future, bringing this much-loved show firmly into the 21st century.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/21/your-starter-for-10-where-are-all-the-women-on-university-challenge,tv-and-radio/2020/apr/21/your-starter-for-10-where-are-all-the-women-on-university-challenge,"Your starter for 10: where are all the women on University Challenge? Judging by the gender balance, you could be forgiven for thinking that this year’s University Challenge grand final had taken place sometime in the 1970s. There wasn’t a single woman on screen for the entire 30 minutes. This is not to detract from the achievement of the winners. The triumph of Imperial college in this week’s final was pleasing – it’s always pleasing to see an Oxbridge college brought down a peg or two – and the breadth of knowledge displayed was incredibly impressive. But we cannot be expected to believe that there wasn’t a single female student at Imperial or Corpus Christi who could have added to those teams. I didn’t do badly playing along at home, answering a number of questions correctly where the contestants on screen did not, and I am very far from being exceptional.

3165,2020-01-03 17:30:08,Port Vale's Tom Pope: ‘As a target man you'd try to rough up John Stones’,"When it comes to swapping shirts at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening, Tom Pope is not exactly counting his chickens. “If the Man City players have had a look at what I’ve said, they’ll probably tell me to bugger off,” the Port Vale captain says, laughing, referring to his comments on social media after watching back England’s Nations League defeat by the Netherlands in June, when he described John Stones as “soft” and “a target man’s dream”, saying he would love to play against the defender every week because he would have a field day. Not for the first time Pope’s tweets catapulted him into the centre of a storm but six months on and before facing Manchester City in the FA Cup third round, the striker unapologetically stands by his words. “One hundred per cent,” Pope says. “It was tongue-in-cheek, saying [I’d score] 40 goals a season. But every single footballer has got their strengths and weaknesses. John Stones is a world-class centre-half and his technical ability is second to none but what I do before a game is I look at the two centre-halves and go ‘Right, who is the weaker of the two?’ And I try to play on the weaker one. It is old-fashioned percentage play. If I play on him, I’ll win 80% of my headers. “If I had a choice of [playing against] John Stones or Virgil van Dijk, I’d go and sit on John Stones. He is physically not the strongest centre-half. He is a ball-playing centre-half. That is not a criticism of him but as a target man, if you are Andy Carroll or Peter Crouch, they would all do the same thing and try and bully him and rough him up. I’d stand by that. “I don’t think it was overly critical. I just pointed out the physical side of his game wasn’t one of his strengths and that it is something I can prey on. As a target man, if you look at a small footballing centre-half, you are licking your lips thinking: ‘I’m going to rough him up and cause some damage.’ That is when the team have to play to your strengths; there is no point trying to play against Man City trying to out-pass them because you’d get mullered.” Pope relishes the blood and thunder of battle and lists Harry Maguire, Aden Flint and Sami Hyypia, whom he faced when Crewe took on Liverpool in 2008 before coming away with Daniel Agger’s shirt as a memento, as some of his toughest opponents over the years. But Pep Guardiola’s side, Pope says, will prove a different proposition. “This Man City team are probably something else,” he says. “Not one person on the planet is going to fancy us to get anything from the game – not even us – and sometimes when there is no pressure on the game, you can have a little feelgood factor about yourselves. You just go out there and try to do the best you can and try not to be embarrassed. And sometimes strange things can happen.” Unsurprisingly Pope does not take himself too seriously. When his Stones comments were dug up at the start of December, Pope referred to himself as a “carthorse”. The striker is a self-deprecating character and throughout this almost hour-long conversation his searing honesty is refreshing and endearing but he knows that his tongue – his tweets, to be precise – have landed him in hot water. Last month the 34-year-old served a one-match ban for abusing Crewe fans after being found in breach of the Football Association’s Rule E3, and has had to stump up thousands of pounds in fines after three separate charges, two from the FA and one from the League Two club. “My wife is at the end of her tether with it. Everybody keeps telling me you need to come off [social media] but I love interacting with people. If I reported everybody who abused me, there would be nobody left on Twitter.” Pope was brought up a mile from Vale Park and a boyhood supporter, going back to the days when his grandfather, Joe, would push him and his brother under the turnstile. These days Pope lives a 10-minute walk from the stadium and is Vale’s longest-serving player. After scoring almost 150 goals across 500 league career appearances he is comfortable in his own skin. “I know what I am, I’m the slowest footballer in the world,” he says. “I’ll come last in any running race but I also know what my strengths are and, if you play to my strengths, I know I am a handful for anybody. When opposition managers and centre-halves are coming off after games shaking your hand and saying: ‘Flipping hell, what a battle or you’ve battered us,’ you know you have still been effective. I’m just an old-fashioned centre-forward. I don’t try to do anything I can’t do. I’m not going to start trying to take people on. I’ll try and get hold of the ball, win my headers and bring people into play.” At 19 Pope ditched a nine-to-five job glazing windows and took a pay cut to sign for Crewe on £200-a-week, seven years on from them releasing him as a boy and after four years on the non-league circuit with Biddulph Victoria and Sneyd FC, a Sunday League team his father, Rob, managed for years. “When you are 15 and scoring goals, people are kicking lumps out of you.” Few of City’s superstars will have had such a similar grounding. “No, but they have all got big houses so. if any of them ever need any windows doing, then maybe I’ll give them a call,” Pope says, breaking into laughter. “You’d go up for a header and land on the floor and they’d stamp on you while you’re down. My old man would always say, ‘Get up, get yourself up.’ You don’t want to give the opposition any thought that you might be weak or that they might be bullying you or have got the better of you. You just get back up and go again.” That will be Pope’s mantra against City, along with sticking to his guns. “I’m not going to be robotic. That’s what they try to do now, they try to silence people. Anthony Joshua, when he’s doing media, I think a lot of it is stage-managed and scripted to keep fans on side. With me, I’ll just say what I think. If we’ve had a 5-0 drubbing the media are always asking for me after because I’ll be honest and not beat round the bush. I’m not going to be silenced. There are a lot worse people on the planet than Tom Pope.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/03/manchester-city-port-vale-tom-pope-john-stones,football/2020/jan/03/manchester-city-port-vale-tom-pope-john-stones,"Port Vale's Tom Pope: ‘As a target man you'd try to rough up John Stones’ When it comes to swapping shirts at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening, Tom Pope is not exactly counting his chickens. “If the Man City players have had a look at what I’ve said, they’ll probably tell me to bugger off,” the Port Vale captain says, laughing, referring to his comments on social media after watching back England’s Nations League defeat by the Netherlands in June, when he described John Stones as “soft” and “a target man’s dream”, saying he would love to play against the defender every week because he would have a field day.

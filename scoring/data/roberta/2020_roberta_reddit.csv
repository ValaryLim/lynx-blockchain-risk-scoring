there's no regulation in defi though so the collateral chain systematic risk, it's there.

so where did all the btc go? is it pooling with that active antpool waiting for me to create my wallet account and they will deposit everything processed while under their pool but without a full account?

let's say for f2pool did, using a timestamp 10 minutes in the future, solve  629,999 but then held onto the block (i.e., not broadcast it).  but then for whatever reason they did share the block privately with antpool who then also was working on 630,000 (while everyone else was still trying to solve 629,999.

then if f2pool gets 630,000 they broadcast both (and likely would have had a message embedded in 630,000 as well).  if antpool gets 630,000, they broadcast f2pool's 629,999 as well as their 630,000.    if either f2pool or antminer detects that some other pool solves 629,999, then both blast out f2pool's 629,999 so as to not have too much hashrate mining to extend the other pool's block.

withholding the block does increase the risk that f2pool's 629,999 would lose permanently, and not be in the ""greatest work"" chain, so i don't see this as being actually what happened.

i do find it odd that nodes got both 629,999 and 630,000 in very rapid succession (a matter of seconds ... well under one minute)?   seriously, the most watched bitcoin block ever in its 11+ years took just 20 seconds to be mined?   possible.  but unlikely.   at the same time, i see ~zero gain from f2pool withholding 629,999, so who knows.",2020-05-12 13:25:38,comments,antpool,0,1.4975194931030273,-1.6998871564865112,"sure there is.

1240,jeffreysbrother1,www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/gl47q9/security_hardware_wallets_robinhood/,"hello everyone!  


question #1  
prior to learning that it's best to associate an exchange account with a fresh email account with a unique handle, i created an account on coinbase with an existing email and purchased a small amount of crypto. would it be safe to transfer that cryptocurrency to a binance us account (which is linked to a new, unique email)?  


another way of asking is this: does a transfer between exchanges record a record of email addresses?  
i want to be as safe as possible, but to be honest, i don't quite understand the reason for these extra security measures.  


question #2:  
is a hardware wallet exchange-specific, or can one hardware wallet be used with multiple exchanges?  


question #3:  
i recently purchased some crypto on robinhood before understanding that the app doesn't allow users to transfer cryptocurrency to a hardware wallet. what's the best line of action here? should i just keep it in robinhood and forget about it, or should i sell in order to reduce risk of a data breach and loss of bitcoin?",bitcoinbeginners,"security, hardware wallets, robinhood",2020-05-17 06:58:26,submission,binance,0,1.4734690189361572,-1.6762285232543945,"security, hardware wallets, robinhood",0.041103191673755646

but i still wonder why his company binance is keeping scamming (sorry to  be rude, but this is the appropriate term i found based on wikipedia) vip 0 customers? these are customers who choosed to not verify their accounts.   
many cases have been reported and never solved. binance suddenly locked the accounts of the users for some so-called ""risk control"" ""unusual activities on account"" or such, asking these users to provide not just their documents, but with some bullish requests like making some videos just like it was movie lol and so many things that most of these people abandoned their money. i read a case here where a guy provided different documents trying to withdraw. who gives  the right to a such off shore company to keep money of  people?  
come on, let the people get their money. not serious for a such company to keep scamming vip 0 customers really just by taking as pretext ""does not want to provide docs"". why do you allow people to use your plaform as vip0 if you plan later to force them to provide kyc? what a irony?",binance,"why is binance keeping scamming vip 0 customers? don't use binance as vip0, your coins will be in danger!",2020-05-06 19:46:18,submission,binance,0,1.4628441333770752,-1.6550278663635254,"why is binance keeping scamming vip 0 customers? don't use binance as vip0, your coins will be in danger!",0.04237604886293411

bittrex, as many of you know, is asking for more detailed info (ssn number, etc) by jan 14th 2020 or you can no longer use them.  i refuse to send them more personal info, so i will be withdrawing all my funds from there and no longer using them.

kucoin has a 2btc withdraw limit per day (unverified) which i'm totally fine with.  that's acceptable.

so, my question is what other exchanges can u.s. customers use that have no kyc and a ~2btc per day withdraw limit?  what other exchanges are similar to kucoin and legit?  huobi?  binanceus?  bitfinex?  kraken?    i am planning on using a vpn for added security.

you dont have a run a node to make a wallet.
making your own wallet is relatively easy, it will provide you with an id and key (password). you can write them down on a piece of paper as a qr code for ex.
then you can use that id and key in myetherwallet (which is actually a missleading name because its a wallet and a node).

those transactions are given to the blockchain via a node. so you can either use a public one or run your own (safer, but honestly hard to run one)

a wallet is just an id and a key, the coins are not literally in the wallet, the coins are registered by the network of computer in the blockchain, and the key is the only way to make them move to another ""wallet id"". 
to do that transaction, you ask the blockchain to make the operation. the thing that does that is a node.

cpp ethereum are open source projects that you can compile yourself to make a wallet and run a node.

for example, if you have 1.0btc equity and your total debt is 0.4btc, binance allows you to transfer 1.0 - 0.4 = 0.60 btc to your spot account. 

you will notice that you cannot transfer anything to your spot account if your margin risk level is below 2 (more borrowed than equity) which also makes sense with the formula above. 

i found this with some trial and error while testing for our new marginbot (coming in a few weeks) that will be offered via tradeium. we have to automatically transfer funds from margin accounts to spot accounts as the user allocates more/less funds to bots managing each account.

[1] these people are mostly directly or indirectly associated with cc. saleem chose not to inform cc because they breached the responsible disclosure embargo twice in the past plus they were and still are attacking him and other security researchers via social media.

bittrex, as many of you know, is asking for more detailed info (ssn number, etc) by jan 14th 2020 or you can no longer use them.  i refuse to send them more personal info, so i will be withdrawing all my funds from there and no longer using them.

kucoin has a 2btc withdraw limit per day (unverified) which i'm totally fine with.  that's acceptable.

so, my question is what other exchanges can u.s. customers use that have no kyc and a ~2btc per day withdraw limit?  what other exchanges are similar to kucoin and legit?  huobi?  binanceus?  bitfinex?  kraken?    i am planning on using a vpn for added security.

i am writing today to seek help and also to warn other people in the community. after more then 4 years in the crypto space i had the first terrible crypto experience and i am feeling left alone especially from bitstamp.

on the 8th of february between 4am and 4:45 am a new password was created, it was logged in into my account. all assets have been converted into btc and the btc amount sent to this btc address:   1mvqhbpvhhbsjgj9jypepzoqtqmnndqmap

i am using 2fa, the 2fa key is safely stored offline. my phone was next to me in my flat. i only life with my wife. obviously i trust her.

there is also no malware on my phone. it has been checked by a technician.

according to bitstamp i have authorized all transactions via mail or 2fa (forgotten password and password change)

a few key facts:

&amp;#x200b;

1. 2fa passwort was only stored physical
2. bitstmap pw only in my head
3. no emails received to authorize transactions
4. no malware on phone
5. phone next to beside table. most likely on flight mode since i always put it on flight mode during sleep. 

&amp;#x200b;

i have no explanation but an unsafe system at bitstamp. the ip who was taking the action was not mine but this:   ip: 91.64.214.247

please share your thoughts if you have an idea which could help.

police has been informed. 

bitstamp is no longer replying to my emails. in fact, it seems they have blocked my ip! 

stay away from bitstamp.

i have a question.

i have a bittrex account with around at this moment $50 worth of currency in it.

i decided to log into my account for the first time in two years only to find out that my account had been disabled. and i am unable to deposit or withdraw.

so i submitted a ticket.. and got word that i needed to verify my account, or they needed extra data, now i don't mind filling out my name and mail address etc. but they are also asking for a copy of passport or an id, and that is something i consider a very shady thing on the internet, even from legitimate companies.

so i'm now locked out of my account, and wondering if these $50 are worth making a copy of my id or my passport, there is a reason that in my country it is illegal for random companies to ask people for passport copies. so am i screwed here? or is there a way around it? 

&amp;#x200b;

bittrex, as many of you know, is asking for more detailed info (ssn number, etc) by jan 14th 2020 or you can no longer use them.  i refuse to send them more personal info, so i will be withdrawing all my funds from there and no longer using them.

kucoin has a 2btc withdraw limit per day (unverified) which i'm totally fine with.  that's acceptable.

so, my question is what other exchanges can u.s. customers use that have no kyc and a ~2btc per day withdraw limit?  what other exchanges are similar to kucoin and legit?  huobi?  binanceus?  bitfinex?  kraken?    i am planning on using a vpn for added security.

i recently deposited my first few sats into blockfi and it seems to be going well. i received a payment for the first time a few days ago and its got me wanting to submit more sats to the platform. howevever, i have a tingling feeling that i can't totally trust this platform is things go for the worst.

i'm pretty sure this place does fractional reserve banking with our crypto but they say its held in cold storage?

and... whats up with this part: blockfi and our partners may experience cyber-attacks, extreme market conditions, or other operational or technical difficulties which could **result in the immediate halt of deposits and withdraws of cryptocurrency either temporarily or permanently.**

why it may be a smart option to not have an e-mail or other account that can be reset by text.

so basically the hacker had knowledge of blockfi's system that employees use and was able to access it using the employee's login.

i could be totally wrong, but it's my best guess.

this is why people do not like using text message for 2fa. nobody seems to be calling phone carriers out that they are the ones causing this security risk by allowing people's phone numbers to be ported by people who are not the account holders.

the confusion from customers is that blockfi offers authenticator 2fa to customers, so it is odd that they were having employees use text 2fa for their system accounts.

op tried to steal up to $1.5 million.

for starters, if they don't have an explicit bug bounty program then the right (and legal) thing to do is to report bugs and not expect payment. anything else is skirting the line with fraud, extortion, and/or blackmail. 

in reality, they could sue op and press charges for grand theft, and even now they could probably press charges for attempting to commit a crime.  with an amount this large the fbi and irs would jump on it instantly. if op made the vulnerability public then that would only increase the charges against op.

i’d also like to mention i have dozens of other wallets and have never, in the time that i’ve been in crypto, had to use a seed phrase yet. but they’re all locked down, except this gem that was needed within a week because of a glitchy app. 

it should say “if you lose your phone or if our glitchy app force quits and logs you out for no reason”  would be helpful to have it connected to my coinbase account but that feature doesn’t seem to work either. and what’s with cb pro not showing my funds after a week? 

you guys are number 1 and should be representing us crypto a little better than a third rate ccp controlled shill. please make it mandatory to use a seed phrase until your app is stable or has another way to retrieve funds. but even meantime, i have a couple grand just chilling in borrowing and lending i can’t even see. 

which i have to say is kind of funny. but infuriating. if bat or 0x moon, i’m cutting someone 🤪

thank you u/coinbasesupport for helping me and for the quick response for my previous query.

i have now received an email stating my account has now been closed and also that my non essential data have been deleted.

however, i have a few questions i hope you could answer:

1. i requested that both my essential and non essential data be deleted. will my essential data/personal data be deleted as requested alongside non essential data?
2. why did i randomly received 2 emails on cancelled orders from 2017?
3. was the emails that was sent from from the associate general counsel a member of staff from coinbase?
4. what was the reason for me not being able to log in and unable to use the forgotten password option. was i hacked? or was i subject to a phishing attempt?

some say online wallets like coinbase and blockchain.com are more secure since they monitor the plataform. but still don't know if they got hack will everyone loose they bitcoins although we have their apps version install in our mobiles? do we have private keys or they sync with the online platform? or the two are independent on the operations?

question #1  
prior to learning that it's best to associate an exchange account with a fresh email account with a unique handle, i created an account on coinbase with an existing email and purchased a small amount of crypto. would it be safe to transfer that cryptocurrency to a binance us account (which is linked to a new, unique email)?  


another way of asking is this: does a transfer between exchanges record a record of email addresses?  
i want to be as safe as possible, but to be honest, i don't quite understand the reason for these extra security measures.  


question #2:  
is a hardware wallet exchange-specific, or can one hardware wallet be used with multiple exchanges?  


question #3:  
i recently purchased some crypto on robinhood before understanding that the app doesn't allow users to transfer cryptocurrency to a hardware wallet. what's the best line of action here? should i just keep it in robinhood and forget about it, or should i sell in order to reduce risk of a data breach and loss of bitcoin?",bitcoinbeginners,"security, hardware wallets, robinhood",2020-05-17 06:58:26,submission,coinbase,0,1.4734687805175781,-1.676228642463684,"security, hardware wallets, robinhood",0.041103191673755646

2638,fruitflavor12,www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/gfhjew/question_about_old_accounts/,"so many years ago (more than 6) i had made accounts on coinbase and other exchanges using a safe-mail.net email address which i still have access to but only checked today for the first time since ages and ages. i never actually had any bitcoins or anything on these exchange accounts but was planning to revisit these accounts now since i had already set them up years ago. 
the thing is, in the inbox of the safe-mail.net email account, there are all of these emails with red subject lines saying ""your accounts were hacked!"" and ""your devices were hacked!"" many of these sorts of messages are in the junk folder but also inbox, and a few as recently as earlier this year.

 i am scared to actually even open any of those emails, but what really freaks me out is that the sender address is my exact safe-mail address.  i don't know if they are phishing emails that i shouldn't open or if they are actually indications that my accounts and this email address have truly been hacked, since the sender address is my exact email address.  

so the whole thing is freaking me out: i'm even worrying about having opened that email account on my phone browser, in terms of hacking or something -- i really don't want to contaminate any currently used devices or accounts or anything by opening a can of worms that may be compromised.  

i really don't know much about hacking, and the very idea freaks me out because i have no idea if i have taken the proper precautions or not.  any information relating to those accounts i only wrote down in a physical notebook, and the bitcoin wallet from that time still seems fine, and has 2 factor authentication (and i didn't use the safemail address for the wallet).  

but what i'm wondering is, should i actually be worried that my accounts using that email address were hacked, or that the email account was hacked? or are these just emails to get my attention to open them and i should just delete them all and everything is safe and i should just login to my coinbase etc accounts and then perhaps change the email address to one that i normally use and doesn't seem so sketchy like this safe-mail account.  

can anyone advise me on this?  

also does anyone know anything about safe-mail.net?",bitcoinbeginners,question about old accounts,2020-05-08 07:15:16,submission,coinbase,0,1.4876666069030762,-1.6918532848358154,question about old accounts,0.03994373977184296

3573,admin_default,www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/g0yovk/unpopular_opinion_hardware_wallets_arent_good/,"i have a ledger nano x but i have not heard of any method of storing key phrases that isn’t either impractical, unsafe, or requires a third party.

first, physically securing your key phrase is impractical for most people, not to mention a technological regression from cryptographic security. home safes are expensive and there are stories of burglars ripping safes from floor boards while the owners were out. and if you can’t get home (like anyone who was locked out during quarantine) you’re out of luck. safety deposit boxes are also [out of the question](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/business/safe-deposit-box-theft.html).

second, you can try to store your key phrase digitally but in the end, you will have to either trust a cloud service provider or store it locally (which means having to physically protect the device it’s stored on). if you store your key phrase on a cloud service like google drive, dropbox, icloud, etc., you’ve put your trust in a company like any other and you may as well have put your bitcoin on coinbase.

lastly, you can try vitalik buterins method of breaking your key into 3 parts and trusting 2 parts each to 3 different trusted friends. personally, i don’t trust people that much. they could misplace it or conspire to steal it.

in the end, a large, reputable exchange with insurance seems like the right balance of security and convenience for now.

in the future, i certainly hope to see some decentralized version of identity verification and secure pass phrase retrieval. until then, what method are you using to keep your coin safe?",bitcoin,unpopular opinion: hardware wallets aren’t good enough yet.,2020-04-14 12:17:42,submission,coinbase,0,1.463374137878418,-1.6631592512130737,unpopular opinion: hardware wallets aren’t good enough yet.,0.04202595353126526

hi!

i have been using abra as my main wallet for the past year, but i want to migrate to a better wallet since there is no way i can withdraw my money in europe from abra. 

also, abra’s technology that fiat and alt coins are tied to bitcoin seems absolutely ridiculous to me.

coinbase seems like an absolute scam - they act like a bank and have your bitcoin in their ‘vault’. i believe this kills the whole idea of cryptocurrency. 

from my research it seems like kraken is the best wallet for europeans (easy withdrawal in fiat).

i reset my phone and the service was back. i was able to get into my coinbase and nothing went missing. i immediately dumped everything into my ledger. so i got lucky there. i then got into my email and changed the password. i then noticed an email alert from earlier in the day letting me know my password had been changed from the uk (i’m from usa) and they used my phone number as the security method. so it seems they were able to get into my email using my phone number and that is when i knew it was a sim swap. 

i then went in and changed all my passwords (everything from my banks to my netflix) and added 2fa to anything that didn’t already have it. i also changed my security phone number on my email account to a google voice number. i am going to go back and do this on anything else that uses texts for 2fa. 

i then called my cell provider and they said my sim was in fact swapped earlier in the morning and swapped back about 15 minutes later (must have been when i reset my phone.) they said they would hand it over to the fraud department. i also tried to get a brand new sim card at the t-mobile store but they were unable to do it because of the fraud department locking my account until they get back to me. 

my question is this. have i done everything i need to do to protect myself from this happening again? i got lucky and it doesn’t seem like i lost anything so far, but i am worried that if they were able to get in once, they can get in again. i’ve been paranoid all day and my stress is trough the roof. changing passwords, adding 2fa, using google voice for text 2fa, and getting a new sim card; will these things protect me from the recent attack as well as prevent others?",cryptocurrency,sim swap attack,2020-02-03 02:01:49,submission,coinbase,0,1.202723741531372,-1.3291559219360352,sim swap attack,0.07365330308675766

there is a small group of people who make disney fan products, skirting copyright laws and the like just barely.

some of these have had disney shut down their payment options, and that's what happened to her.

she makes mickey ears in various styles, and she is extremely good at it, making the highest quality and cutest ears i've ever seen, by hand, with felt and needle.

then it happened. one day she announced she was having trouble with payment processors. guess she finally got popular enough that they took notice.

visa and mastercard cut her off, googlepay turned off her account, and applepay was next.

her last remaining option, strangely perhaps, became paypal. 

now this was a huge problem for a lot of her regular customers because she typically sells out within a minute of putting up her latest creations.

i was using gpay, and lost out on a sale due to paypal.

being friendly with her i got the inside scoop and urged her to add bitcoin cash to her site and sent her some of the introductory material from coinbase, so she now has two remaining payment options, paypal and cryptocurrency.

i then offered to help her test the system.

the more this kind of thing happens, the more we will be able to spread the message about permissionless payments. she didn't know anything about cryptocurrency, but was able to accept it with a day's worth of research.

2. what phone carrier runs the phone number you linked
3. where you live
4. if you used a randomized username
5. if you used a randomized password
6. if you stored those passwords in excel on dropbox
7. if you enabled 2fa
8. if you enabled ***good*** 2fa
9. if you disabled password reset on your email and phone accounts

in the past this was a side effect of one miner and their partners using  secretive asicboost, but since 2017 segwit being activated the incentives to use this instead of rolling overt asicboost where no empty blocks need to be occasionally be created this is no longer the reason.

trusttoken requires you to wire money to a hong kong bank in order to make any of their coins, so unless you have free wire transfers, that's a big disadvantage.

pax also requires wire transfers, so until they enable ach, i won't use that one.

i like the concept of dai in that it is decentralized and trustless. but they already had issues keeping the peg which is why they created multi-collateral dai. i guess i'm okay with trusting an entity like coinbase to keep the coins collateralized, but i appreciate what dai brings to the table.

1.get yourself a hardware wallet. ledger nano s or trezor are the most recommended. i use ledger; very easy.

2. from the ledger, you'll get 24 word. these are the private key. write these down on the sheet of paper that you get from the ledger box. the sheet is numbered, so you sequentially will know when to write down which word.

3. keep the sheet of the number (the seed as it is called), in a safe space. presumably a safe with a lock. this hinders internet connection and isolates the 24-words. remember; the 24 words are the key to your bitcoin. you can have any ledger nano s and regain access of your bitcoin, but only if you have the 24 words. the 24 words is essentally where the bitcoin is; not the hardware wallet itself (ledger).

4. set it up via live live (use tutorials on youtube; it is easy). from the ledger program called live live, you can finally get the receiving address. copy it.

5. go into your coinbase account and paste it after pushing send bitcoin. make sure that the address is correct (usually it is enough to look at the last three and the first three letters). test out sending a small amount first, so that you are sure it came through.

6. it will take some time before the btc gets to your hardware wallet, but it will be there after 6 confirmations.

&gt; tls pinning would not have resolved the issue as the moonpay infrastructure was compromised and the malicious code served correctly.

certificate pinning would absolutely solve the issue.  the trinity wallet allows connection to and loading of content from moonpay servers.  with certificate pinning this would be blocked.  sure moonpay servers might have been compromised or you might have dns hijacking of those servers but if you have certificate pinning of a whitelist of hosts the wallet can connect to, a connection to and loading content from the moonpay cdn would never be allowed in the first place 

&gt; illicit versions of moonpay’s software development kit (sdk), which was being loaded automatically from moonpay’s servers (their content delivery network) when a user opened trinity. the code was loaded into the local trinity instance, and, after the user’s wallet was unlocked, decrypted the user’s seed and sent the seed and password to a server controlled by the attacker.

for example a security issue was raised in 2014 with coinbase android wallet because it didn't have certificate pinning.  this was when security was barely taken seriously and the amount of money was tiny.  6 years later, iota still didn't take security seriously.  after all this, does iota wallet now have certificate pinning implemented?  i haven't seen anything it their posts that it does.  iota is still blaming moonpay.  you trust this team with security?  this is remedial.

i had a recent curiosity recently, as i finally noticed the existence of usdc.

no header hashing in the merkle tree  
it's a binary data tree, with the leaves at the bottom  
the transaction hashes are the leaves  

*    hash every transaction  
*    arrange the transaction hashes in pairs  
*    hash each pair of hashes  
*    now you have a layer of nodes, one level above the leaves  
*    arrange these hashes in pairs, hash each pair of hashes  
*    each level has half the number of nodes of the level below  
*    repeat until you get a level which has only 2 hashes  
*    the merkle root hash is the hash of these 2 hashes  

in the mining context, the miner creates a block of transactions, including the coinbase transaction, imports the previous block's header hash into the header, calculates the merkle tree and merkle root hash, then ...  

*    iterate the nonce from 0 to 4294967295  
*    change the extranonce in the coinbase transaction  
*    recalculate the merkle root hash  
*    repeat  

note that if the miner is changing only the coinbase transaction, he only needs to recalculate the hashes at the left edge of the tree, not the entire tree

&gt; the extra nonce is almost like hacking the coinbase to find more possible txids which will give you the correct hash?

it's less deliberate than that. the miner's job is to find an 80-byte block header which has a hash which meets the target criterion. the 80 bytes consist of version, hashprevblock, hashmerkleroot, time, target and nonce. version, hashprevblock and target can not be varied by the miner. the time precision is one second, so it can be varied once per second. by elimination, if the nonce exhausts in less than one second, the merkle root hash must be changed. it could be changed by going to the mempool and finding a few extra transactions to add to the block. it's faster to change a few bits in an inconsequential part of the coinbase transaction

i'm not sure if i grasped everything but got the gist. my understanding of merkle trees is a bit iffy. 

i think you start by taking the hash of the block header and the first txid, and then the hash of that and the second txid, and so on, then at the end try to find a nonce in the 32-bit space. if you don't you can add junk data to the coinbase then the hash of that changes, and you can try running through the 32-bit nonce space again. is that right?

in general, it's better to keep bitcoin on a wallet which gives you access to the private key. this means, you and you alone have full control of the coins. an exchange like coinbase etc do **not** give you full control of the coins. you have to ask them when you want to move coins in or out, and they can refuse you service, or ask to provide personal details and so on, before they give you your coins.  

you should pick a wallet which lets you control your own coins, although this comes with some level of responsibility (backing up properly).

all redditors are equally wise and full of shit.  you'll need a bit of dyor here.  my love for electrum is based on:

* one of the most widely used wallets out there
* open sourced
* they respond to issues and prs submitted on their github
* they have a good / active subreddit
* it's written in python
* it works on everything but ios (which i don't use)
* it pairs with all major hw wallets seemlessly

all redditors are equally wise and full of shit.  you'll need a bit of dyor here.  my love for electrum is based on:

* one of the most widely used wallets out there
* open sourced
* they respond to issues and prs submitted on their github
* they have a good / active subreddit
* it's written in python
* it works on everything but ios (which i don't use)
* it pairs with all major hw wallets seemlessly


&gt; thanks again

basically you have a key that breaks down into two exponents that when taken together mod a specific compound number (which is based on two primes) results in the same number.

basically m^pq (mod n) = m

where m is the message, p is the private exponent, q is the public exponent, n is the compound number based on 2 primes.

if you take m^p (mod n) the result will be pseudorandom number c (where c is the ciphertext).

the cool part is that this number can only be obtained *if you have the private key.* it would take an insurmountable amount of time to brute force this number.

further, c has the property that c^q (mod n) = m because c = m^p (mod n) and thus c^p^q (mod n) = m^p^q (mod n) = m^pq (mod n) = m

that means that someone that has the public key can verify this signed message while it remains statistically impossible to brute force the message or learn anything about the keys.",2020-03-20 07:16:33,comments,compound,0,1.5007095336914062,-1.7058520317077637,"you know, i suppose it isn't hard to describe rsa message signing. hopefully you know enough about modulo math to follow.

i made the mistake to install [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) app, give them my email but not activate the account because i didn't want to go further and give them my telephone number, kyc etc.

since that day, [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) scammers spam me every 2 days with an email ""just 2 steps away! activate your account now!"".

there is no unsubscribe link, no way to stop receiving their spams and they keep sending that email every 2 or 3 days, this is ridiculous. what kind of company does this, if not a scammy one ?

i tried to email them about that, guess what they replied ""just confirm and activate your account and log in your account to unsubscribe"". this is stupid, i don't want to activate the account !

**well, don't make the same mistake, don't install that app and never give them your email.**

i have two phones: 
phone a (old iphone)
phone b (newly restore iphone from the image of iphone a)

everything transferred except the google authenticator 2fa codes - i had to manually set these up for every website that uses them. that said, there doesn’t appear to be a way to fully disable and renew these on crypto.com wallet without entering seed phrase and fully deleting the wallet from phone a - ideally i’d only do this once i was sure i could access the funds from phone b.

i can see all account details on phone b, i just can’t send funds without the auth code from phone a, which has to be sent back.

i have to send phone a back to apple and i’m a little concerned as customer service hasn’t gotten back to me -

we're unable to determine exactly why your bank declined our attempt to validate your card. kindly note that your bank does not provide us with a reason for the decline.

some common reasons why an authorization could fail:

* some banks have restrictions on internet transactions. you may want to check with your credit card company to see if they have such a restriction.
* the billing address included on our site does not match the billing address on your credit card statement.
* amazon is not set up to accept the cvv2 security code associated with credit cards. your bank may be able to temporarily lift this requirement.
* if your bank statement reflects a successful 1.00 usd authorization, a processing issue with your bank may have prevented the authorization from reaching us.

i consider [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) to be a very trustworthy company, with strong leadership.

they have a good following, with people in reddit and discord who will point out any issues - there haven't been any significant issues that give me cause for concern and i've been following them for about 2.5 years.

competitors such as coinbase and binance are also doing well, but [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) is the only one to offer the visa debit card which stores fiat and gives attractive offers ([https://medium.com/@techboy/the-essential-guide-to-the-mco-visa-debit-card-from-crypto-com-61d7b2f358c9](https://medium.com/@techboy/the-essential-guide-to-the-mco-visa-debit-card-from-crypto-com-61d7b2f358c9)). companies such as coinbase and tenx have cards, but i only want to use the mco card.",0.0395127534866333

as i understand it, ""staking"" dapp tokens is used to access the resources that the dapp network provides, which i don't really have a use for at present. should i just stake them anyway even though i don't need the resources? or are there any i can stake to that will generate a passive income?

""new research from outlier ventures lays out the landscape of blockchain development in the crypto space. and things aren't looking good for eos"" &lt;- **misleading information**. things are looking very bright for eos (check the attached links)

""new research from outlier ventures indicates eos has seen a massive exodus of developers from the platform."" &lt;- **misleading information** (b1 started to concentrade their ressources on other products than on the protocol, because in version eosio 2.0 its already awesome. so this make sense to put some developing ressources to new products, which are needed more than eos 3.0)

&amp;#x200b;

""developers working on the eos platform fell more than 85% compared to a year ago github were down a whopping 94% for the beleaguered protocol over the same time period. eos dapp activity is down 70% over the last year."" &lt;- **lets see the argument a little closer and with some thinking**

**eos established itself with the massive performant version 2.0** and **focus their ressources** now on **ibc** with other private/public eosio chains, the development of the **dappnetwork**, the developing of useful **dapps, dex's, defi** and more **products**. with eosio 2.0 the protocol is pretty grown up, one of the best outthere and no more in need to have so much developer correcting it like other protocols who still try to catch up.

achieved by simplification, e.g. issues like this:

which is peanuts, but things would go (at some point) down to core-code or even hardware-level.

one person, which does nothing else than permanently simplifying, with the (obviously needed) catalytic backup of the c-level, especially the ceo.

of course its clear that this will not happen, cardano's mentality cannot accept this (very similar to ethereum/consensys/paritytech mentality).

the last ones will be gone once i've extracted any relevant essence.

i'll still lurk a little bit around here, but will focus on those now (max. 1 week per system) :

* **tezos** (strange presentation), **cosmos** (looks nice), some weird stuff from **disney** and others, and finally reaching the ""**elite**"": some **hyperledger** projects.
* **eos2.0** is back on the radar (and they use kingly c++)

i'm sure that within a month, i'll find **the 3 code-bases** which are worth a dive-in.

stuff is kept here (if i don't decide to delete it, too)

anyways.

while the spread of cryptocurrency continues to grow rampantly, the current dapp experience is far from perfect. making a new move, chromia is doing some very unique things in the space, relational blockchain, horizontal scaling with sidechain(s) for each dapp, powerful programming language. chromia would become the most user friendly dapp hosting platform.

essentially, chromia’s goal is to build a platform which offers superior performance for decentralized applications, whilst providing the tools to make development as easy as possible for developers of all backgrounds.

creating a platform that is highly decentralized. each dapp hosted on its platform, is programmed to run on its own blockchain, any mismanagement or overloading of the network of one dapp will remain problematic for that specific chain only, and will not interfere with the wider chromia ecosystem.

quality user experience is the aim of every platform, that's why chromia is designed with the requirements of developers and users explicitly in mind, built to facilitate the creation of genuinely scalable, secure &amp; feature-rich decentralized applications.",dapps,thinking of creating and hosting dapps? think chromia.,2020-01-11 14:24:04,submission,dapp,0,1.5158648490905762,-1.731654405593872,thinking of creating and hosting dapps? think chromia.,0.037416134029626846

what you are describing is something more suited to the chainlink decentralized oracle network (staking , crypto-economic incentives etc). neos layer 1 oracle is a simple oracle that fetches data from any public api and publishes the result on-chain to be used once  that's all. as far as i'm aware there's no aggregation or 'error processing', so if the user requires something like that then they need to do it themselves manually in their smart contract or dapp. i think the neo oracle nodes elected to fetch the data may need to reach a bft style consensus on the call for it to be published on-chain (eg &gt; 2/3 of oracle nodes need to have same result), but nothing more than that.

so if you just send your token to a smart contract, it has no way of knowing you did anything and won't be activated. 

to get around this, erc20 implements the following pattern:

instead of sending your token to a contract, you call a function on the contract and tell it to take tokens from you. it can then do with those tokens as it pleases.

&amp;#x200b;

so for instance, there'll be some uniswap function called taketokens or some such. when you want to send 10 tokens to uniswap, you call taketokens(10) and the smart contract then tells the erc20 standard to transfer 10 tokens from you to it. after which it does all the uniswap magic.

hopefully you can see the security flaw. if you give a contract carte blanche to take tokens from you, why stop at 10? why not just take your whole balance and run to cayman islands?

erc20 advocates a numeric permissioning where you first declare a spendable allowance for a particular contract. you say something like uniswap can only take 10 tokens. then you call uniswaps taketokens(10) and if it tries to take more than 10 the transaction fails and is rolled back.

let's say for f2pool did, using a timestamp 10 minutes in the future, solve  629,999 but then held onto the block (i.e., not broadcast it).  but then for whatever reason they did share the block privately with antpool who then also was working on 630,000 (while everyone else was still trying to solve 629,999.

then if f2pool gets 630,000 they broadcast both (and likely would have had a message embedded in 630,000 as well).  if antpool gets 630,000, they broadcast f2pool's 629,999 as well as their 630,000.    if either f2pool or antminer detects that some other pool solves 629,999, then both blast out f2pool's 629,999 so as to not have too much hashrate mining to extend the other pool's block.

withholding the block does increase the risk that f2pool's 629,999 would lose permanently, and not be in the ""greatest work"" chain, so i don't see this as being actually what happened.

i do find it odd that nodes got both 629,999 and 630,000 in very rapid succession (a matter of seconds ... well under one minute)?   seriously, the most watched bitcoin block ever in its 11+ years took just 20 seconds to be mined?   possible.  but unlikely.   at the same time, i see ~zero gain from f2pool withholding 629,999, so who knows.",2020-05-12 13:25:38,comments,f2pool,0,1.4975194931030273,-1.6998871564865112,"sure there is.

bittrex, as many of you know, is asking for more detailed info (ssn number, etc) by jan 14th 2020 or you can no longer use them.  i refuse to send them more personal info, so i will be withdrawing all my funds from there and no longer using them.

kucoin has a 2btc withdraw limit per day (unverified) which i'm totally fine with.  that's acceptable.

so, my question is what other exchanges can u.s. customers use that have no kyc and a ~2btc per day withdraw limit?  what other exchanges are similar to kucoin and legit?  huobi?  binanceus?  bitfinex?  kraken?    i am planning on using a vpn for added security.

hi!

i have been using abra as my main wallet for the past year, but i want to migrate to a better wallet since there is no way i can withdraw my money in europe from abra. 

also, abra’s technology that fiat and alt coins are tied to bitcoin seems absolutely ridiculous to me.

coinbase seems like an absolute scam - they act like a bank and have your bitcoin in their ‘vault’. i believe this kills the whole idea of cryptocurrency. 

from my research it seems like kraken is the best wallet for europeans (easy withdrawal in fiat). 

am i right in my thinking? what is the best wallet for europeans?

bittrex, as many of you know, is asking for more detailed info (ssn number, etc) by jan 14th 2020 or you can no longer use them.  i refuse to send them more personal info, so i will be withdrawing all my funds from there and no longer using them.

kucoin has a 2btc withdraw limit per day (unverified) which i'm totally fine with.  that's acceptable.

so, my question is what other exchanges can u.s. customers use that have no kyc and a ~2btc per day withdraw limit?  what other exchanges are similar to kucoin and legit?  huobi?  binanceus?  bitfinex?  kraken?    i am planning on using a vpn for added security.

you dont have a run a node to make a wallet.
making your own wallet is relatively easy, it will provide you with an id and key (password). you can write them down on a piece of paper as a qr code for ex.
then you can use that id and key in myetherwallet (which is actually a missleading name because its a wallet and a node).

those transactions are given to the blockchain via a node. so you can either use a public one or run your own (safer, but honestly hard to run one)

a wallet is just an id and a key, the coins are not literally in the wallet, the coins are registered by the network of computer in the blockchain, and the key is the only way to make them move to another ""wallet id"". 
to do that transaction, you ask the blockchain to make the operation. the thing that does that is a node.

etana custody is the banking partner for kraken's usd deposit.

you are making a wire transfer from your account (at your bank) to krakens account (at etana).

wire transfers in america are very slow compared to a sepa transaction in europ.  
 they normally take 3-5 business days (in worst case much longer) and are quite costly.  
 wire transfers are not processed on weekends (except you payed like 50 bugs for express transfer).  
 as you said you are waiting for 6 days, but 2 days are weekend, so you are still within normal waiting time for a wire transfer.  
 

so your money is most likely still on the way from your bank to etana.  
 

and as etana is a rather young/modern banking institute, i’d wager is probably your bank that’s slowing down the process, maybe even on purpose.

i will not dig too much into it but the main advantages are safe sharding with practically unlimited scalability, logging into different websites in 100% decentralized way without need for **any** private information. not even your name is necessary to prove that you are a real human being. another neat thing are airdrops, because it allows the person organizing the airdrop to know that no person will be able to claim it twice- thus making the airdrop amount even higher per person because of decreased risk (check out [fairdrop](https://fairdrop.io)). when the mainnet starts in q3-q4, there will be sharding technology, and later on the messaging app and much, much more.

currently, idena is sitting around the 8th place (every cryptocurrency in existence included) by the number of nodes, and it will probably be on the first place thru the 12 months (this is just my personal estimate :) ).

kucoin has a 2btc withdraw limit per day (unverified) which i'm totally fine with.  that's acceptable.

so if i got it right, with just one on-chain transaction you practically get unlimited off-chain tps which is awesome.

however, if you aim for global adoption with billions of users, there is not enough space in ~2mb blocks to on-board so many people to level 2 in a reasonable amount of time. the lightning network whitepaper suggests 133mb as a minimum required block size for global adoption, so even if you apply currently planned optimizations it doesn't look like ~2mb can cut it.

so what is the long-term goal here? waiting for a blocksize increase to get consensus, i.e. by increases in cpu speed and bandwidths? or are there other optimizations on the horizon that can enable global adoption of l2 solutions at the current block limit? i was surprised to find that bitcoin core roadmap still has a dynamic blocksize cap in it, is this still being pursued?

then there is no reason for bcn to exist at all, because not a single block mined throughout the entire voting period voted for activating the ifp. all bch miners chose not to vote for ifp, not just jiang, which is transparent evidence through nakamoto consensus that they didn't want to activate ifp and risk a split with bcn.

jiang didn't realize ifp was a bad idea, he realized that a split was possible, and splits are a bad idea, because splits are bad for business. the bsv split was bad for business, and a bcn split would be too.

yes, i was around. the risk of a ""reference client"" is only problematic if the financiers of the reference client don't have the desires of the entire ecosystem at heart. ifp would be miners funding devs, not shady vc entities or companies with their own competing products (e.g. blockstream/liquid).

if it was discussed many times before, then why do people bring it up nonstop?

&gt;a fucking client-fork and a huge community and a quarter million dollars of funding for this new client just because of the direct refusal of that ifp, so people like you add absolutely nothing but noise. 

forking it was easy. the quarter of a million is for new developments this year. meanwhile abc raised a whole million.

&gt;had it been amaury or someone with a face discussing it, and making any sense of the discussion, no one would be screaming “shill” back at him.

he is too busy to entertain you

&gt;but when a random new account who acts like a literal pest inserting the ifp discussion in every other post, keeps repeating the same points even when technically refuted, keeps wasting people’s time by endless loops of pointless discussion about things that are often meant to do exactly that, waste people’s time, that’s when you get labelled a shill and a buzzing little fly.

what technical refutations?

&gt;so get your facts straight: had you been here to “learn”, we would teach you. had you been a decision maker, we would discuss it with you. had you been an og, we would reason with you.

so you only reason with some people, and use unreason with others?

&gt;but a random annoying little pest who has no respect for people who contributed far more than he ever will, who refuses to listen and blatantly acts like a mouthpiece, that’s why the community tends to highlight your shilling behaviour and then give you nicknames or block you, as many have in the recent while.

i just heard recently that by doing this, you are giving the dapp permanent access to the tokens in your wallet, which is fine so long as the dapp isn’t compromised. but apparently there is a possibility the dapp becomes compromised and your tokens can be drained from your own wallet.

is this a legitimate risk? is it a risk for certain dapps (dapps without admin keys like uniswap are safe?)? what are good security practices for handling token allowances?",ethfinance,what’s the deal with token allowances?,2020-02-29 04:56:19,submission,uniswap,0,1.4984798431396484,-1.702634334564209,what’s the deal with token allowances?,0.039123810827732086

so if you just send your token to a smart contract, it has no way of knowing you did anything and won't be activated. 

to get around this, erc20 implements the following pattern:

instead of sending your token to a contract, you call a function on the contract and tell it to take tokens from you. it can then do with those tokens as it pleases.

&amp;#x200b;

so for instance, there'll be some uniswap function called taketokens or some such. when you want to send 10 tokens to uniswap, you call taketokens(10) and the smart contract then tells the erc20 standard to transfer 10 tokens from you to it. after which it does all the uniswap magic.

hopefully you can see the security flaw. if you give a contract carte blanche to take tokens from you, why stop at 10? why not just take your whole balance and run to cayman islands?

erc20 advocates a numeric permissioning where you first declare a spendable allowance for a particular contract. you say something like uniswap can only take 10 tokens. then you call uniswaps taketokens(10) and if it tries to take more than 10 the transaction fails and is rolled back.

&gt;any thoughts?

the require in your example checks for the msg.sender. this does not directly protect agains reentrancy attacks.

a simple reentrancy attack is an attack where your function calls another function that reenters the first function. for example function a transfers ether. then the fallback function of the receiver can be to call function a. if no checks are implemented the function will send eth again, which would drain the contract. a possible protection is a lock modifier like the new uniswap v2 implementation.

    uint private unlocked = 1;
    modifier lock() {
        require(unlocked == 1, 'uniswapv2: locked');
        unlocked = 0;
        _;                //this executes the logic in your function
        unlocked = 1;     
    }

it is not guaranteed that this protects against all reentrancy. but it protects against the example. because if you receive the ether and call function a (with the lock modifier) again it will not execute (because the first call changes the variable unlocked to 0.

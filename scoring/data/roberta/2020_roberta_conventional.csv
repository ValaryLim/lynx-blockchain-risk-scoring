Still, he is slowly developing the ability to write backwards, and has started incorporating what he calls ‚ÄúMr Squiggle‚Äù elements into the shows at Whiddon Hornsby: residents place their hands on the window, then he traces around and creates drawings from their handprints.

The Whiddon Hornsby crowd are big fans of Doris Day tunes, Helwend says. Alongside What a Wonderful World, You Are My Sunshine, and Aussie standards such as Waltzing Matilda and the Happy Little Vegemites jingle. The window therapy shows were, Helwend admits, ‚Äúa bit shaky at first‚Äù. Uncertain of even leaving the house at the beginning of lockdown, he was also ‚Äúterrified of potentially exposing a resident‚Äù. Even so, those early performances were ‚Äúincredibly emotional‚Äù, he says. ‚ÄúThe initial reaction was just joy.

901,2020-04-22 20:30:06,Weatherwatch: what is the dew point?,"The dew point is the temperature at which a certain area of air must be cooled to for dew to form. It is also commonly interpreted as a measure of the air‚Äôs moisture content. As air cools, the amount of the gaseous form of water it is capable of holding decreases, and as such, cooling will eventually result in it reaching saturation point, beyond which condensation into liquid water droplets occurs. This is the main process behind cloud formation in the atmosphere. Of course, dew can also form on surfaces on earth. When the surface (for example grass or cars) cools below the dew point temperature of the air adjacent, condensation droplets from the air deposit onto that surface. If surface temperatures fall below 0C and below the dew point temperature, instead of water vapour gas condensing to water droplets, it transitions directly to crystals of ice, in the form of frost. While frost formation in winter months is rather common, surface temperatures in autumn or in spring are less likely to fall down to the air‚Äôs dew point, aided by the shorter overnight cooling periods. Hence, dew and frost do not form as readily, especially on objects which can have larger stores of heat in them, such as roads.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/22/weatherwatch-what-is-the-dew-point,Liquid,0,1.4801087379455566,-1.680518388748169,"Weatherwatch: what is the dew point?The dew point is the temperature at which a certain area of air must be cooled to for dew to form.

The triumph of Imperial college in this week‚Äôs final was pleasing ‚Äì it‚Äôs always pleasing to see an Oxbridge college brought down a peg or two ‚Äì and the breadth of knowledge displayed was incredibly impressive.

I suspect the problem with this is twofold: students are almost certainly not working hard enough to recruit women and make their teams inclusive, but also women themselves may not be as keen to appear on television, for a number of reasons.

1265,2020-01-03 17:30:08,Port Vale's Tom Pope: ‚ÄòAs a target man you'd try to rough up John Stones‚Äô,"When it comes to swapping shirts at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening, Tom Pope is not exactly counting his chickens. ‚ÄúIf the Man City players have had a look at what I‚Äôve said, they‚Äôll probably tell me to bugger off,‚Äù the Port Vale captain says, laughing, referring to his comments on social media after watching back England‚Äôs Nations League defeat by the Netherlands in June, when he described John Stones as ‚Äúsoft‚Äù and ‚Äúa target man‚Äôs dream‚Äù, saying he would love to play against the defender every week because he would have a field day. Not for the first time Pope‚Äôs tweets catapulted him into the centre of a storm but six months on and before facing Manchester City in the FA Cup third round, the striker unapologetically stands by his words. ‚ÄúOne hundred per cent,‚Äù Pope says. ‚ÄúIt was tongue-in-cheek, saying [I‚Äôd score] 40 goals a season. But every single footballer has got their strengths and weaknesses. John Stones is a world-class centre-half and his technical ability is second to none but what I do before a game is I look at the two centre-halves and go ‚ÄòRight, who is the weaker of the two?‚Äô And I try to play on the weaker one. It is old-fashioned percentage play. If I play on him, I‚Äôll win 80% of my headers. ‚ÄúIf I had a choice of [playing against] John Stones or Virgil van Dijk, I‚Äôd go and sit on John Stones. He is physically not the strongest centre-half. He is a ball-playing centre-half. That is not a criticism of him but as a target man, if you are Andy Carroll or Peter Crouch, they would all do the same thing and try and bully him and rough him up. I‚Äôd stand by that. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it was overly critical. I just pointed out the physical side of his game wasn‚Äôt one of his strengths and that it is something I can prey on. As a target man, if you look at a small footballing centre-half, you are licking your lips thinking: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to rough him up and cause some damage.‚Äô That is when the team have to play to your strengths; there is no point trying to play against Man City trying to out-pass them because you‚Äôd get mullered.‚Äù Pope relishes the blood and thunder of battle and lists Harry Maguire, Aden Flint and Sami Hyypia, whom he faced when Crewe took on Liverpool in 2008 before coming away with Daniel Agger‚Äôs shirt as a memento, as some of his toughest opponents over the years. But Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side, Pope says, will prove a different proposition. ‚ÄúThis Man City team are probably something else,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNot one person on the planet is going to fancy us to get anything from the game ‚Äì not even us ‚Äì and sometimes when there is no pressure on the game, you can have a little feelgood factor about yourselves. You just go out there and try to do the best you can and try not to be embarrassed. And sometimes strange things can happen.‚Äù Unsurprisingly Pope does not take himself too seriously. When his Stones comments were dug up at the start of December, Pope referred to himself as a ‚Äúcarthorse‚Äù. The striker is a self-deprecating character and throughout this almost hour-long conversation his searing honesty is refreshing and endearing but he knows that his tongue ‚Äì his tweets, to be precise ‚Äì have landed him in hot water. Last month the 34-year-old served a one-match ban for abusing Crewe fans after being found in breach of the Football Association‚Äôs Rule E3, and has had to stump up thousands of pounds in fines after three separate charges, two from the FA and one from the League Two club. ‚ÄúMy wife is at the end of her tether with it. Everybody keeps telling me you need to come off [social media] but I love interacting with people. If I reported everybody who abused me, there would be nobody left on Twitter.‚Äù Pope was brought up a mile from Vale Park and a boyhood supporter, going back to the days when his grandfather, Joe, would push him and his brother under the turnstile. These days Pope lives a 10-minute walk from the stadium and is Vale‚Äôs longest-serving player. After scoring almost 150 goals across 500 league career appearances he is comfortable in his own skin. ‚ÄúI know what I am, I‚Äôm the slowest footballer in the world,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come last in any running race but I also know what my strengths are and, if you play to my strengths, I know I am a handful for anybody. When opposition managers and centre-halves are coming off after games shaking your hand and saying: ‚ÄòFlipping hell, what a battle or you‚Äôve battered us,‚Äô you know you have still been effective. I‚Äôm just an old-fashioned centre-forward. I don‚Äôt try to do anything I can‚Äôt do. I‚Äôm not going to start trying to take people on. I‚Äôll try and get hold of the ball, win my headers and bring people into play.‚Äù At 19 Pope ditched a nine-to-five job glazing windows and took a pay cut to sign for Crewe on ¬£200-a-week, seven years on from them releasing him as a boy and after four years on the non-league circuit with Biddulph Victoria and Sneyd FC, a Sunday League team his father, Rob, managed for years. ‚ÄúWhen you are 15 and scoring goals, people are kicking lumps out of you.‚Äù Few of City‚Äôs superstars will have had such a similar grounding. ‚ÄúNo, but they have all got big houses so. if any of them ever need any windows doing, then maybe I‚Äôll give them a call,‚Äù Pope says, breaking into laughter. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd go up for a header and land on the floor and they‚Äôd stamp on you while you‚Äôre down. My old man would always say, ‚ÄòGet up, get yourself up.‚Äô You don‚Äôt want to give the opposition any thought that you might be weak or that they might be bullying you or have got the better of you. You just get back up and go again.‚Äù That will be Pope‚Äôs mantra against City, along with sticking to his guns. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to be robotic. That‚Äôs what they try to do now, they try to silence people. Anthony Joshua, when he‚Äôs doing media, I think a lot of it is stage-managed and scripted to keep fans on side. With me, I‚Äôll just say what I think. If we‚Äôve had a 5-0 drubbing the media are always asking for me after because I‚Äôll be honest and not beat round the bush. I‚Äôm not going to be silenced.

As a target man, if you look at a small footballing centre-half, you are licking your lips thinking: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to rough him up and cause some damage.‚Äô That is when the team have to play to your strengths; there is no point trying to play against Man City trying to out-pass them because you‚Äôd get mullered.‚Äù Pope relishes the blood and thunder of battle and lists Harry Maguire, Aden Flint and Sami Hyypia, whom he faced when Crewe took on Liverpool in 2008 before coming away with Daniel Agger‚Äôs shirt as a memento, as some of his toughest opponents over the years. But Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side, Pope says, will prove a different proposition. ‚ÄúThis Man City team are probably something else,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNot one person on the planet is going to fancy us to get anything from the game ‚Äì not even us ‚Äì and sometimes when there is no pressure on the game, you can have a little feelgood factor about yourselves. You just go out there and try to do the best you can and try not to be embarrassed. And sometimes strange things can happen.‚Äù Unsurprisingly Pope does not take himself too seriously. When his Stones comments were dug up at the start of December, Pope referred to himself as a ‚Äúcarthorse‚Äù. The striker is a self-deprecating character and throughout this almost hour-long conversation his searing honesty is refreshing and endearing but he knows that his tongue ‚Äì his tweets, to be precise ‚Äì have landed him in hot water. Last month the 34-year-old served a one-match ban for abusing Crewe fans after being found in breach of the Football Association‚Äôs Rule E3, and has had to stump up thousands of pounds in fines after three separate charges, two from the FA and one from the League Two club. ‚ÄúMy wife is at the end of her tether with it. Everybody keeps telling me you need to come off [social media] but I love interacting with people. If I reported everybody who abused me, there would be nobody left on Twitter.‚Äù Pope was brought up a mile from Vale Park and a boyhood supporter, going back to the days when his grandfather, Joe, would push him and his brother under the turnstile. These days Pope lives a 10-minute walk from the stadium and is Vale‚Äôs longest-serving player. After scoring almost 150 goals across 500 league career appearances he is comfortable in his own skin. ‚ÄúI know what I am, I‚Äôm the slowest footballer in the world,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come last in any running race but I also know what my strengths are and, if you play to my strengths, I know I am a handful for anybody. When opposition managers and centre-halves are coming off after games shaking your hand and saying: ‚ÄòFlipping hell, what a battle or you‚Äôve battered us,‚Äô you know you have still been effective. I‚Äôm just an old-fashioned centre-forward. I don‚Äôt try to do anything I can‚Äôt do. I‚Äôm not going to start trying to take people on. I‚Äôll try and get hold of the ball, win my headers and bring people into play.‚Äù At 19 Pope ditched a nine-to-five job glazing windows and took a pay cut to sign for Crewe on ¬£200-a-week, seven years on from them releasing him as a boy and after four years on the non-league circuit with Biddulph Victoria and Sneyd FC, a Sunday League team his father, Rob, managed for years. ‚ÄúWhen you are 15 and scoring goals, people are kicking lumps out of you.‚Äù Few of City‚Äôs superstars will have had such a similar grounding. ‚ÄúNo, but they have all got big houses so. if any of them ever need any windows doing, then maybe I‚Äôll give them a call,‚Äù Pope says, breaking into laughter. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd go up for a header and land on the floor and they‚Äôd stamp on you while you‚Äôre down. My old man would always say, ‚ÄòGet up, get yourself up.‚Äô You don‚Äôt want to give the opposition any thought that you might be weak or that they might be bullying you or have got the better of you. You just get back up and go again.‚Äù That will be Pope‚Äôs mantra against City, along with sticking to his guns. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to be robotic. That‚Äôs what they try to do now, they try to silence people. Anthony Joshua, when he‚Äôs doing media, I think a lot of it is stage-managed and scripted to keep fans on side. With me, I‚Äôll just say what I think. If we‚Äôve had a 5-0 drubbing the media are always asking for me after because I‚Äôll be honest and not beat round the bush. I‚Äôm not going to be silenced. There are a lot worse people on the planet than Tom Pope.‚Äù",0.0391184501349926

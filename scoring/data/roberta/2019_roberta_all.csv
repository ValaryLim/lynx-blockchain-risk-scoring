4452,527,2019-06-08 09:00:13,"Muna on Harry Styles, imposter syndrome and Trump-baiting. Whatâs a band to do when, after an arduous two years of studio-based creative excavation, they finally complete their anticipated second album? All-night drug binge? Alcohol-fuelled rampage? A nice holiday somewhere with a pool? Well, if youâre emo-pop trio Muna, AKA Katie Gavin, Josette Maskin and Naomi McPherson, you go for something a little more holistic. âWeâre getting massages tonight to celebrate the fact that weâre done and to decompress a little bit,â says McPherson on an occasionally hard-to-follow three-way conference call from Los Angeles that often carries the incense-coated whiff of group therapy. Muna, it turns out, deserve that well-earned R&amp;R. Their new single, Number One Fan â the first to be taken from the forthcoming Saves the World album â may swap the indie-leaning goth-pop of 2017âs About U in favour of 80s Madonna-meets-Carly Rae Jepsen kitsch, but itâs a glittering Trojan horse hiding a song about struggling to find your self-worth when the external adulation suddenly stops. âNo matter how many times someone tells you youâre amazing, you have to learn to believe that yourself,â says McPherson. âItâs hard when you come home [from touring] and youâre like: âWell I knew I was a piece of shit and this proves it!â Itâs easy to get depressed.â Gone too is the all-black Matrix cosplay look of that first album, replaced by a softer mix of My So-Called Life and Monica from Friends, all high-waisted mom jeans and vest tops. While it may seem like a simple case of ânew era, new lookâ, the bandâs singer and lyricist Gavin insists itâs a much fairer reflection of who they actually are this time around. âThis is what we do everyday and we just want to wear our everyday clothes,â she explains. âWe donât need to dress it up any more because what we do is cool enough.â For perpetual over-thinker Gavin, who has a habit of ending her sentences with âif that makes any senseâ, itâs partly about letting her defences down. âI loved my old haircut but I think it did a lot of work in terms of protecting me,â she says of her previous âdo, which involved a blunt fringe, pointed âbangsâ and a severe undercut. âIf I hadnât had that as a natural defence and a way of keeping people from seeing into me, I donât know if I would have been able to handle the amount of attention.â While About U didnât exactly make Muna household names, it pushed them into the public eye as a queer and deeply politicised pop act at a time when that still felt out of the ordinary. During one memorable Jimmy Kimmel performance of the albumâs totemic single I Know a Place â transformed into an anthem of resistance following the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting â Gavin changed the lyrics in the songâs middle eight to include the line âheâs not my leader even if heâs my presidentâ, with the band having previously sported homemade âFuck Trumpâ T-shirts. Their willingness to be outspoken, mixed with their sexual identity, leads to them repeatedly being asked for quotes on topics that could weigh down lesser bands. âItâs validating that people care about our brains and not just our beauty,â laughs Gavin, before turning deadly serious. âI think there were times on the first album where we all struggled with imposter syndrome in our own way. Sometimes you would feel like a politician because youâre preaching certain principles when youâre speaking publicly, and then youâre having these failures in your private life where youâre not living out those values.â Touring with silk-suited Mick Jagger impersonator Harry Styles in 2017 offered another opportunity for the band to feel as if they had stumbled into a world they werenât quite ready for. âThat was the height of imposter syndrome, like: âHarry Styles is in my green room, what is going on?ââ laughs McPherson. âJust full body disassociation.â We talk about Stylesâs own queering of the mainstream, which led to criticism from some as âgay-baitingâ, and also the idea of queerness in general being subsumed into the mainstream. âIf it gets absorbed then at least its in there,â says Maskin. âI would rather different performances of gender or different performances of sexuality be normalised. Growing up and feeling different was not a very pleasant experience and at least [now] kids can grow up thinking: âItâs OK to be whatever I am.ââ Thereâs a ripple of agreement down the line. âI can be gay as fuck and really do anything I want and exist and have a life where I can love and be happy,â she continues. âThings will get better because we will continue to push forward and weâre resilient. Weâre here, weâre queer.â It was after the Styles tour, and the imposing silence of being back home, that they rushed into writing what would become album two. It was tricky at first. âI donât think we allowed ourselves the opportunity to change and grow as musicians,â sighs Maskin. Six months in, Number One Fan came along and kickstarted a newfound creative bravery. âIt started out being a bit more brooding and then it shifted into the electro club banger that it is today because we decided not to get in the way of what the song wanted to be,â explains McPherson, who co-produced the album. Was it always going to be the lead single? âI think if it was an album track it would be the weirdest thing,â she continues. Gavin, meanwhile, is more graphic, conjuring up images of crowning vaginas. âItâs the head of the baby, basically,â she says before collapsing into hysterics. A lot of Gavinâs lyrics were written following a period of âheartbreak and withdrawalâ, during which time she purposefully steered clear of romantic relationships, with one song, the near six-minute-long Itâs Gonna Be Okay, Baby, a latter period Alanis-esque journal-entry-as-song, touching on communism, suicide and home haircuts (âwith those scissors from the desk in your dorm roomâ). âShit just gets weird when you realise the person youâre in love with is a symbol of the type of love youâre not willing to give yourself,â Gavin says, apparently warming to the Morissette connection. On paper, Muna sound as if theyâre high on LAâs finest Kool Aid. In fact, one comment from Gavin about the dangers of living in a bubble features the words âseedling stageâ, âunmet needsâ and ânutrientsâ. But their infectious friendship-as-therapy mannerisms mixed with an earnestness that creeps under your skin means at one point I find myself asking: âAre you still hopeful about America?â It is a ridiculous question but itâs testament to their big ideas that they donât flinch. âI have to have some degree of hope or whatâs the point?â says McPherson. âWe have hope for the world,â Gavin continues. âI donât know if I can speak to the future of the nation but thatâs also because thereâs a question mark around the concept of nations and borders, but I think on this record weâre saying we have hope for humanity.â The album title, Maskin says, represents the fact that they âdo genuinely believe that saving yourself is the key to saving the worldâ. Cynicism takes over, however, when I question how they can sustain so much faith when, letâs be honest, a lot of people are awful. Thereâs silence. âWow, youâre that bitch!â laughs Gavin, proving, perhaps, that some people canât be saved.

4459,526,2019-06-09 07:00:20,"Ocean Vuong: âAs a child I would ask: Whatâs napalm?â. While he was an undergraduate, Ocean Vuong formed the habit of writing at night. During the day, he studied literature at Brooklyn College and worked in a cafe. At night, he stayed up writing poems. It wasnât just the sense of isolation that comes from being the only one awake, when âyou look out of the window and itâs completely dark and youâre at sea in this little shipâ. It was more that writing in the off-hours relaxed his knack for self-criticism. âYou get the last word of the day,â he says. âThe editor in your head â the nagging, insecure, worrisome social editor â starts to retire. When that editor falls asleep, I get to do what I want. The catâs out to play.â The poems that came out of those night-time efforts were published in 2016 as Night Sky With Exit Wounds, the success of which still amazes the author â the book won a Whiting award that year, and in 2017 scooped both the Forward prize and the TS Eliot prize. Vuong, who is 30, was not from a background from which writers traditionally emerge. As a two-year-old, he had been brought to the US from Vietnam as a refugee and settled with his family in the working-class town of Hartford, Connecticut. No one in his family spoke English. When his father left, his mother got work in a nail salon, menial work for little reward and a quality of life that Vuong had no particular expectation of exceeding. If Night Sky tackled the absent father as myth, then his debut novel, On Earth Weâre Briefly Gorgeous, reckons with the mother and grandmother who raised him and it is the influence of these women â courageous, difficult, devastated by the ripple effect of the Vietnam war â that forms the spine of the novel and asks the central question: after trauma, how do we love? We are in Vuongâs open-plan living room in Northampton, Massachusetts, a leafy college town where he teaches creative writing at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Peter, his partner of 10 years, has taken the dog out. Vuong is slight, with a silver earring in one ear and the habit of pushing his tortoiseshell glasses up his nose. He speaks, as he writes, in poetic imagery, what he calls âthe metaphor as autobiography of the gazeâ. In the novel, the world seen through a speeding car window âsurges by like sidewise gravityâ. A bird on a windowsill appears not as a bucolic symbol but âa charred pearâ. To Little Dog, the protagonist â so named by his family to protect him beneath a cloak of worthlessness â the world is an ugly place, in which beauty is made more so for the improbability of existing at all. âFreedom,â he says, âis nothing but the distance between the hunter and its prey.â That On Earth Weâre Briefly Gorgeous is one of the most anticipated novels of the year â the novelist Max Porter has called it âstaggeringly beautifulâ, observing that âit seems obvious now that a gay young poet born in Saigon would write the great American novelâ â is, in large part, down to its perfect engineering, a piece of autobiographical fiction that avoids all the traps of that genre. It is fluid, moving the way thought moves, in circles not lines, and written in the form of a letter to Little Dogâs mother that he knows sheâll never read. It is easy to imagine a bad version of this novel in which any one of its preoccupations might have overgrown to capsize it. It might have been the Opioid Novel, or the Vietnam Novel, or the Exploitative World of the Nail Salon novel. It might have been the Gay Adolescent Love novel or the Violent Childhood novel, all themes that are touched upon lightly while still assuming a fully weighted presence in the narrative. How Vuong does this is a mystery, as is the seamlessness with which he moves between scenes of violence in the Vietnam war to scenes of violence in the home in Connecticut, to love scenes with a doomed boy called Trevor. The book has a poetic density that is at once elliptical and unflinching in its gaze, a testimony to the endlessly complicated dynamics of damage. âSometimes being offered tenderness,â writes Vuong, âfeels like the very proof that youâve been ruined.â Vuong grew up in a world in which he was marginalised across every axis â class, race, sexuality. His was a violent household. In a memoir piece he wrote for the New Yorker two years ago, which would form the basis of many scenes in the novel, Vuong, addressing his mother, recalled âthe time you hit me with the remote control. A bruise I would lie about to my teachers. I fell playing tag.â And,âthe time you threw the box of Legos at my head. The hardwood dotted with blood.â And, âthe time with a gallon of milk. A shattering on the side of my head, then the steady white rain on the kitchen tiles.â Post-traumatic stress disorder was something no one had any idea about at the time, âexcept in veteransâ. But there is no question, looking back, that both his grandmother, who saw her village in Vietnam razed by US soldiers, and his mother, ripped from everything familiar for a new life in the US, where her husband beat her before leaving, were suffering from PTSD. Violence was the ugly expression of this trauma, but with distance, Vuong could see a positive release of that energy, too â chiefly in the way that his mother and grandmother told stories. âI didnât know this until I talked to other Vietnamese-Americans â that it was rare for families to talk about the war,â he says. Partly it came out of boredom. They were broke, stuck in the house with each other and âwe had no TVâ. But there was something else going on, too. âThe stories, at first, were folklore. My grandmother would tell a ghost story, then she would say: oh, that was after the napalm. So through cycles of these stories, that world started opening and as a child I would ask: whatâs napalm? They ploughed on. It was almost intoxicating for them to create a mythology of their lives, because they were so powerless. They were all women. The men were gone; they did their harm and were gone. And they were empty hands, had no English, were powerless everywhere else. But when it was time to tell the story, they held everything.â Vuong had no context for what he was hearing. He only knew that in the stories, these women who counted for nothing outside, ran through the fire and survived. âThey turned themselves into myths and it had a rhetorical power. They turned themselves into the Odyssey.â In the novel, the trauma of Little Dogâs mother and grandmother shines through in grimly humorous ways. Lan, the grandmother, yelling at his addled mother to get back in the car, shouts to get through to her, âget back in the helicopterâ. Buying a dress from the Salvation Army, his mother asks Little Dog to read the label and find out, âis it fireproof?â In the family mythology, Vuong was the single last hope of these indestructible women and when, in the mid-2000s, Hartford was hit by the opioid epidemic, itâs the thing that stopped him from leaning towards drugs. âA lot of my friends were dying. And I thought: OK, I can die.â Worn out by poverty, bullying, bereavement and violence, he regarded this outcome as regrettable, but âI think that might not have been enough, were it not for me being my family âs only hope. Because they were also dying, in a different way: financially, mentally. And I thought, I canât die. Literally I canât die.â He wanted to change his familyâs story. He wanted to make his mother happy. He wanted to exceed the expectations of someone born to his station in life. So what did he do? He smiles. âI went to business school.â There was a year in early adulthood when Vuong and his mother didnât speak. He knew life had been hard for her, leaving Vietnam and dealing with his father, about whom he knows very little other than that after his mother kicked him out, he âwent off to do criminal things and ended up going to jailâ. But he hadnât yet got to the stage of forgiving her. âIt was the worst, for both of us,â he says. âAnd when we looked at each other again, we just sobbed and said: oh, we canât do that. Weâve got to find a way.â This happened before Vuong had written a single line, and it was important; âa pivotal moment to understand that anger destroys, not only those around you, but especially yourself. Anger is energy â you can get a lot done with anger; you can write multiple books. Weâve read those books and you realise as youâre reading them: oh, this is not for me. Itâs their own project. So I didnât want to write angry. I didnât want to be angry. I saw what anger did, growing up, and it was powerful, a force to be reckoned with, but it didnât lead to anywhere that I was interested in going.â This isnât the received wisdom among many of those applying to study creative writing at college, where it is sometimes assumed that having something to rage about is a definite advantage. After eight weeks at business school â which he characterises as âlearning to lieâ â Vuong dropped out and enrolled to read literature at Brooklyn College. He started to write poetry. And then he had an unsettling experience. Freshly arrived in New York, he turned up at a poetry reading one night, pretty sure he was about to âmeet my peopleâ, having spent the previous two decades as a fish out of water. âAnd the first thing someone said to me was: hey, Iâm at Sarah Lawrence, where are you studying? And I said: oh, Iâm not in an MFA [master of fine arts]. And he just turned around and walked off.â He bursts out laughing. âIt was amazing.â Another student on a prestigious writing programme chatted to Vuong for a few moments, before saying: âYouâre so lucky â youâre gay and from war.â The idea of Vuongâs childhood as a generator of great material for fiction is one that makes him laugh like a drain. These days, if any of his upper-middle-class students grouse that they donât have a good backstory, he mildly points out that Virginia Woolf got one of the best novels ever written out of someone basically crossing a lawn. At the time, however, he was shocked and disappointed. He hadnât been prepared for the merciless competition of the New York poetry crowd âwhich depended on appearances, soirees and parties. So I just holed up in my apartment and the library.â His confidence cratered. He wondered if heâd made a terrible mistake. Then he hit upon an unexpected remedy. âA huge moment in my education as a writer was reading biographies. I beg my students to do it, because everything that theyâre feeling, Sylvia Plath felt 70 years ago. And Ginsburg and Lorca and Rimbaud. Thereâs Virginia Woolf, this genius, whoâs going on a crisis walk. You read the prose and you would never think this woman has any doubt. And yet here she is, out there, asking: what am I doing?â Vuong thinks he was lucky in some ways. âI had no pressure. I could really experiment with my voice. I could play, and find pleasure in it. I see with my students that theyâre under a lot of pressure from their families. A parent will say to me: âmy future Pulitzer winner!â and I just groan. Poor kid. What do you say to that?â He started going to open mic poetry events, which were shabbier and more democratic than formal readings, and at one of which he met a law student called Peter. To that point, Vuongâs relationships had been largely dysfunctional, âbad, bad relationships in almost this cliched trope of seeing whatâs familiar in violent, self-destructive folksâ. His horizons had been limited in other ways, too. It is an odd side-effect of poverty that you become trapped in a previous era, he says; new things take longer to arrive, and when they do, no one has time to absorb them. âYou donât have no time. Thatâs the thing everybody in my community says: I ainât got no time for that!â He laughs. âBeing poor is about waiting, I learned. Youâre waiting in line for welfare. You go to the ER, you wait. You want to file for sexual assault? You wait. And so everybodyâs in a queue and one thing that happens is that youâre in a cultural time warp. Youâre in the past. So when I went to New York in 2007, I had no iPhone, no Facebook; in my community, when it comes to technology and access, they are mostly in the late 90s.â They were also culturally fairly regressive, although in his own home at least, homophobia was one of Vuongâs lesser problems. (There is a heartbreaking bit in the novel in which Little Dog wakes to find âFAG4LIFEâ scrawled on his familyâs front door in red paint and he tells his mum that it reads: âMerry Christmas, Ma. See? Thatâs why itâs red. For luck.â) When he was growing up, his mother and grandmother werenât thrilled by his sexuality, but âbecause they came from a long line of rice farmers, they were close to native traditions in Vietnam, and those communities had intersex folks who were seen as having all-seeing power. They were powerful people and there was a mysticism associated with that. That doesnât mean they hoped their children would be queer. But although they were shocked, they had a very practical way of looking at things. Thatâs what I admired about them. Their view is that this is borrowed time. We shouldâve been gone up in smoke. But now weâre here, letâs just live.â The downside to this attitude was economic ruin. âIt leads to financial woes and bankruptcy. Maxed-out credit cards.â Heâs laughing now. âOK, after 20 years, the partyâs over! Letâs think about savings! Theyâre all in financial ruts because they had that mentality.â It was a joyfulness, or at least a somewhat constructive outlook, that Vuong associates with women who emerge from trauma as opposed to destructive and self-destructing men. It still amazes him, looking back, how the women in his family â his mother, his grandmother, his aunts â dealt with the threat of their husbands. âThe incredible thing that I can never quite understand was how they were able to kick them all out. The men had access to jobs, money, a patriarchal presence in the world, and even though they had troubles too, as immigrants and refugees, we come from a patriarchal tradition in the old country just as deeply rooted as in the west. In some cases, when men are talking to each other, women arenât supposed to even be in the room. So that was what they were coming out of. And to think divorce?! These things were still taboo where they came from. And they all really did it.â The question of courage underlines everything Vuong writes, both in terms of the characters and in the nerve held by the writer creating them. Night Sky With Exit Wounds, published when he was 27, and which âtook off in ways that no poet ever suspects will happen, and should not expect againâ, dared to imagine scenes in which brutality and sensuality combined. (In one scene, the poet describes his father masturbating in a bathroom after he has beaten his mother, observing âthat a man in climax is the closest thing to surrenderâ.) The novel has a similarly shocking breadth of sympathies. In both, Vuongâs ultimate aim was to dignify the experiences of his childhood with the solemn, years-long gaze of the novelist. âThe great male writers of the European tradition, be it Proust, Tolstoy, Turgenev, deemed that those most inspiring to them existed in a white aristocracy,â he says. âYou read those books and you wouldnât even know that people of colour existed in Europe. To each his own, and that was their choice. But I wanted to say: these lives, of women, and even of poor white people â these lives are worthy of literature. As Turgenev looked at the crumbling Russian empire, I look at these folks in a different crumbling empire and deemed that these are inspiring lives to an artist.â He also wanted to say something about where the cost of war falls, not from the vantage point of the grand historical epic, but from inside the small, cramped sadness of a house still flattened decades after the conflict has ended. âItâs the stories of our species that men create these wars and women clean them up. They clean them up emotionally, they have to deal with the PTSD that comes home, they have to postpone their own healing, forgo their own self-care, in order to hold these households together. They literally nurse these broken bodies back to health. I wanted a book to honour that without romanticising it. To say women have been doing this and theyâre not necessarily these heroic legends. Whatâs the mental cost of the women who do these extraordinary things? In the book, the cost is their own private life.â A few months ago, Vuongâs mother was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and he has been commuting back and forth to Hartford to accompany her to chemotherapy. After a dire admission to hospital, during which, he says, she was in so much pain âit sounded like warfare and I was ready to bury herâ, she is responding to treatment and even hopes to come to his book launch. He thinks of something she said to him when he first left for New York. âShe told me: itâs OK for people to think youâre a fool.â Vuong laughed and said: âReally? Why?â and his mother replied: âBecause then theyâll tell you everything about them. You can see them from all their angles.â Itâs the wisdom of his life. The subversive power of being âa small, queer, person of colourâ is that Vuong has the ability to see everything. He smiles. âNobody hides themselves from a fool.â â¢ On Earth Weâre Briefly Gorgeous is published by Jonathan Cape (Â£12.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

4468,525,2019-06-09 20:38:51,"Shelley Kerrâs plan to pick off England leaves Erin Cuthbert isolated | Sophie Lawson. A goal down fewer than 15 minutes in thanks to Nikita Parrisâs clinically taken spotâkick, the lowerâranked British nation needed to dig deep but their tanks already appeared spent. It was the biggest match of their careers but the 11 on the pitch looked out of their depth and lost. The buzz coming into the game had been intense, the players of course refusing to admit that who their opposition was mattered. Their first World Cup match was their own, not Englandâs, and the narrative grew old. But there in Nice, in the scorching late afternoon sun with the humidity bordering on the unbearable, it could have been Utrecht in 2017, when England won 6-0 against Scotland. The Scots had scrambled in defence and when the Lionesses pushed against those in blue they wilted. The formation left the team buried in their own half with Erin Cuthbert surrendered as a lone centre-forward, abandoned in attack with a sea of green grass separating her from her compatriots. It was not because it was England, it was because it was the third-ranked nation in the world and Shelley Kerr had opted for defensive banks, figuratively parking the bus. Yet it failed to work, the windscreen smashed by Parrisâs penalty, the high intensity and relentless press from the Lionesses enough to take the wheels off the bus. It was not going to be another 6-0. The team under Kerr are far too good for that. But at the Allianz Riviera the memories of Scotlandâs debut in the Euros came flooding back. In Scotland Womenâs 47-year history they had faced their southern neighbours 25 times before the World Cup, the Lionesses with 22 wins to their name, Scotland with just two, and here England looked certain to extend their advantage. Banked up but confusingly slack when it came to actual manâmarking, blue would get only so close to white before standing off and letting their bigger sisters muscle their way through. The Tartan Army remained in full voice throughout, urging their players on, but it was for nought, Englandâs second a near hammer-blow for Scotland just before half-time. If Kerr demanded change, there was none to be seen on the pitch initially in the second half. The shoulders started to droop, the balmy evening stretching on ahead of the debutants. The heat began to tell and as Scotland slacked off even more, England began to ease a boot off of the gas. The relaxed tempo of the second half gave Scotland a chance, Kerrâs substitutions combined with a desperately needed change of shape opened the game up. Kirsty Smith and Chloe Arthurâs fresh legs benefited the team but the opportunity to play Arsenalâs Lisa Evans higher up was the clincher for Scotland. From the brink of humiliation, Scotland pulled themselves back with Evans the instigator. A mistake from Steph Houghton was all the encouragement the Gunner needed to open up the chance and set Claire Emslie up. She gave Scotland a lifeline and put her name down in the history books as the first female Scotland player to score at a World Cup. And the first senior Scotland player to score at the showpiece tournament since Craig Burley in 1998. The goal caused a ripple of noise at the stadium, the Tartan Army drowning out the Lionessesâ fans, but with 11 minutes left on the clock and Scotland already spent, their final charge was a laborious one. The humidity had lessened over the course of the match but, forced to chase and pick themselves up time and again over the 90 minutes, the Scottish legs were heavy, flesh sun-kissed and burnt. Time fast ran out for Scotland in Nice, their first ever World Cup match one that would go down as a defeat but from 0-2 and nowhere Kerrâs team had dug out a 1-2, the goal not just a galvanising one but one that could yet change the final standings of the group. With the top four third-placed teams advancing to the knockouts, Scotland slashed their goal deficit in half in one swift move. Given the nature of the team who could be vying for one of those four berths, Scotland had once again done what they can to take their destiny into their own hands, a goal at the World Cup â any goal at the World Cup â a positive to build on. The match was a lesson for all in the Scotland camp, the excessive defence and lack of creativity something that will be remedied before they travel north to Rennes to face Japan, and then a last group game against Argentina.",0,0,2.037824869155884,-2.045074224472046,0.01657902252171837

4470,524,2019-06-09 23:01:46,"Dioramas of death: cleaner recreates rooms where people died alone. It was at a trade show for the funeral industry that Miyu Kojima had what might seem at first like a macabre idea. Kojima, 27, works for To-Do Company, a cleaning firm that specialises in the apartments of the recently deceased. Many of their jobs involve kodokushi (âsolitary deathsâ), where people die alone and are not found for days, a phenomenon that has recently gripped the Japanese imagination. The company was advertising its services at the trade show by displaying photos of the rooms theyâd cleaned. âBut the photos are gruesome to look at,â Kojima said. âI felt they lacked respect for the deceased and for their family to be exposed like that.â So she bought some glue, polystyrene board, knives and other craft materials, and got to work. The results are laid out on a table at the To-Do offices in north Tokyo, a narrow warehouse crowded with two vans and boxes of cleaning supplies, and they are astonishing: miniature models of rooms in which people have recently died. The bodies are gone but the evidence is preserved in hyper-realistic detail: stained blankets, darkened floors, abandoned cats. The rooms are composites, not specific scenes, helping to soften the blow so that people take the time to understand rather than instantly look away. âQuite often death is a dark side of our lives, and things are hidden,â Kojima said. âBut I wanted people to know the reality.â She recreates it in meticulous detail. Bookshelves are stocked with volumes of biochemistry, quantum physics and Harry Potter. Photos of ancestors and award certificates hang on the walls. These rooms are well lived in, recognisable and human, making it all the more unsettling that death can reach inside â sometimes without anyone outside noticing. âFor the family of the kodokushi, it would be a huge shock to accept that the body was left undiscovered for so long. How often do people call their aged father or mother who lives alone? In between your calls, he or she could die and you wouldnât know for days, weeks, or even months.â Kojima also makes models of houses where hoarders have let their rubbish mount up, known in Japan as gomiyashiki â literally âtrash mansionsâ. âQuite often the gomiyashiki owners are alive and hold respectable jobs, like lawyers or nurses, that tend to have irregular working hours,â she explained. âA small thing will trigger them to end up piling up the rubbish to this extreme: the loss of a partner or job, divorce, or simply not knowing how to clean. In one case the owner was the victim of a stalker, and became too scared to go out to clear up the trash.â Again, it is all about the details: tiny Krispy Kreme boxes, tiny plastic bottles, tiny cockroaches. Kojima had no craft training and taught herself using YouTube and experimentation: for example, finding a way to reproduce perfect detail on printed objects such as books or food cartons by using a photocopier to reduce the size of the originals. âAt the beginning I just used readymade furniture for a dollâs house,â she said. âBut gradually I started making my own.â In one of the models of a bathroom, she positioned and pasted each tile by hand, and used real grout. âThe only item I bought was a readmade wash basin. The rest I made with resin.â Yuji Masuda, her boss, encourages her to work on the models while at the office, and some of the other 13 staff have started pitching in. Masuda founded the company 18 years after he found his next-door neighbour dead at her house. When no family or friends showed up to help, he took it upon himself to dispose of her possessions and clean her place. âBack then, there were hardly any specialised companies like mine,â he said. âSuch things were left to family, but these days many people are too busy to take care of such business.â Masuda says theyâve noticed an increase in solitary deaths, which he blames on the long-term ripple effect caused by the bursting of Japanâs real-estate bubble: most families now have two incomes, and elderly parents are increasingly left alone. The numbers are certainly rising. In 1980, 4.3% of men and 11.2% of women older than 65 lived alone. By 2015, the figures were 13.3% and 21.1%. Meanwhile, kodokushi has become a household word. In Tokyo alone, 4,777 people died this way in 2017, according to Bureau of Social Welfare and Public Health. More than half were men, and the vast majority were older than 60. Gruesomely, roughly a third died two to three days before the body was found â and almost 10% of bodies lay there for more than a month. Kojima, who joined the company seven years ago, said she was particularly drawn to the problem and wanted to help. Why? âWell, it might be something to do with my father. He lost his job and his family because of his excessive drinking and lived alone. I was with my friends after school in a cafÃ© when my mobile phone rang. It was from my sister, who told me to rush to the hospital. When I arrived, I found my father unconscious in bed, having suffered a stroke alone. He had been discovered lying on the floor of his house by my mother who had visited him by chance. He never regained consciousness.â Troubled by the thought that had her mother not visited he might have lain dead alone for weeks, she began to empathise with the impact of solitary deaths on families. Her first day on the job was in the intense heat of a Tokyo August. The body had been untouched for months. âOf course the smell was intense but not as bad as I had imagined,â she said, emphasising that the To-Do staff wear approved industrial air masks. People often ask her if the experiences make her feel scared or haunted. âI donât get squeamish if I think of the deceased as a member of my own family and not as an unknown person,â she said. âAnd why should they haunt me? I am there to clean the room where they lived and died, and in this way I am helping them to depart.â The families donât always feel that way. She meets many of them in the course of cleaning, and most â 80%, she reckons â behave coldly towards her. Solitary deaths often mean estranged relatives. But every so often itâs different: âAs I clear the possessions of the deceased and talk to the family about him or her, their tension starts to loosen. Sometimes they burst into tears and sometimes I cry with them too. âBy the time the room is cleared and cleaned, they can accept the death of their family member who had to live and die alone, and they can move on. When I see that moment, I feel my jobâs done. I always think that my role is to help people in despair, to understand and stand by them, and make this world more caring for others.â In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

4505,523,2019-06-13 08:21:21,"Binge TV: a lovely sugar rush, but ultimately unsatisfying | Sarah Hughes. How do you watch TV? All in one gulp or paced out slowly in weekly increments? This week a Radio Times survey suggested that the latter method is falling out of fashion, with 80% of respondents suggesting that theyâd lost sleep binge-watching a programme, and more than half claiming to have watched more than eight hours of a show in one sitting. Yet how satisfying is binge-watching really? Yes, thereâs something comforting about knowing that the next episode is only ever one short countdown away, but itâs also the case that being able to watch shows when we want and as frequently as we want (at least until that terrible moment when the episodes dry up) is increasingly affecting the way we consume TV â and not necessarily for the better. Take, for example, the conversation around spoilers. Itâs no coincidence that this has only intensified in the era of binge TV, when people no longer have any clear idea of when they can start discussing a major twist. Worse, binge-watching encourages us to put our individual viewing experience centre stage, positioning it as equal to, if not more important than, the programme being watched. This means that weâre enraged when someone quicker off the mark discusses a show before weâre ready, leading to bitter arguments that would have been avoided if everyone was watching at the same time. And itâs not just spoiler etiquette thatâs affected. The worst thing about binge-watching isnât the online fury or the fear of missing out or even the sneaky lying to your family about how many episodes youâve really watched. Itâs that it denies viewers the pleasure that a truly communal TV experience brings. That sense of television as a communal rather than an individual experience is the reason why the yearâs most talked about shows â Game of Thrones, Line of Duty and Fleabag â have been those that aired weekly, forcing audiences to wait. Being made to wait seven days for each new episode of Game of Thrones is the reason why even the smallest plot points were analysed and debated and why viewers became so creative with memes and gifs. Similarly, if Line of Duty had been binge-watched, no one would have had time to concoct elaborate theories about OCGs and UCOs, while watching Fleabag back-to-back would have entirely lessened the cultural impact of the Hot Priest, a man whose appeal (or lack thereof) was driven by the fact that fans were feverishly discussing it every week. Of course a version of those conversations might still have happened if those shows had been available to watch all at once but they wouldnât have dominated popular discourse in quite the same way. Not convinced? Then consider the example of The Last Kingdom. When it aired weekly on BBC Two, the travails of Uhtred, son of Uhtred were readily available to chew over in bite-sized chunks. The excellent third series has been on Netflix since last November but any discussion was over almost before it had truly begun. Similarly, Deutschland 83 was one of Channel 4âs biggest hits when it aired weekly. Deutschland 86, the sequel, barely caused a ripple after being released in its entirety on Walter Presents via All 4 earlier this year. The very nature of binge-watching means that the conversation becomes fragmented and, while itâs wonderful to find your tribe, those people who are obsessing over Call My Agent or the select (but clearly correct) few who have tracked down the second series of Harlots, itâs hard to top the rush of knowing weâre all watching the same thing at (roughly) the same point in time. At this point, committed bingers are no doubt shaking their heads in despair at my old-fashioned and out-of-touch ways. I understand. Truly, I do. Itâs nice to have the power and the freedom to watch something at your own speed, to finish something when and as you want. But itâs nice too to have the space to think about what youâve watched, to mull over what just happened while waiting for the next episode to air and to feel part of a wider moment (even if your biggest contribution is to say âwhy on earth is everyone watching this crap?â). At its best, television has always been a two-way conversation between creators and viewers, stuffed full of tasty morsels to discuss. The trouble with binge-watching is that it turns that over-stuffed banquet into a superficially filling but ultimately unsatisfying meal for one. â¢ Sarah Hughes writes on TV and the arts",0,0,2.181339979171753,-2.261033773422241,0.01163109667769252

4635,499,2019-06-29 18:52:49,"Germany 1-2 Sweden: Women's World Cup quarter-final â as it happened. Congratulations to Sweden, whose dream of a maiden World Cup win survives. And commiserations to Germany, who will have to wait for World Cup number three. All thatâs left is to direct you towards the match report ... and here it is, just a simple click away. Enjoy, and thanks for reading. The semi-final line-up, then. England v USA (Tuesday) Netherlands v Sweden (Wednesday) Sweden are the first team in the knockout stage of this World Cup to come from behind and win! Theyâre the first side to inflict such a turnaround on Germany in the World Cup since the USA did it in 1999. Tonight theyâre gonna party. They cavort in celebration, exhausted but exhilarated. Germany, who went into this match as favourites, look stunned ... but they were very much second best today. They couldnât cope with Stina Blackstenius at any point, and the LinkÃ¶pings striker delivered the killer blow just after the break. Pity poor Lina Magull, whose magnificent opening goal was all for nothing. Sweden will play Netherlands in the semi-final next Wednesday, after a deserved victory thatâs been 24 years in the making! 90 min +5: Rolfo is replaced by Hurtig. Sweden are so close to the semis now. 90 min +4: Asllani looks to have won a corner on the right, but the flag goes up for a goal kick. She nearly complains her way into the book. 90 min +3: A huge chance for Germany! Huth is sent scampering down the right and wedges a cross towards Hegering at the far post. Under pressure from Glas, she flashes her header high and wide from close range. 90 min +2: Marozsan manages to dig out a cross from the tightest of positions on the right. Lindahl does extremely well to claim a ball that would have looped into the net. 90 min: Oberdorf dribbles down the left and cuts back for Dabritz, who shoots straight at Lindahl. There will be six minutes of added time. 89 min: Blackstenius sends a screaming shot over the bar from 25 yards. Sweden have had their chances to put this to bed. Incidentally, the offside decision against Germany was preposterously marginal, Magullâs arm dangling over the line. But whatâs right is right. 88 min: What a chance for Germany to save themselves! Itâs another free kick, this time out on the right. Marozsan waves her wand at the ball, curling it to Oberdorf at the far post. Lindahl had come out flapping and missed. The goal was gaping ... but Oberdorf sent her header wide. 86 min: Now Poppâs knocked to the floor by Ilestedt. A free kick, 30 yards out. Before itâs taken, Sweden swap Rubensson with Bjorn. Then Marozsan floats the free kick into the mixer. Popp clips Seger, and itâs a pressure-releasing free kick. 84 min: The tension is palpable as referee Stephanie Frappart converses with the denizens of the VAR studio. Popp was definitely offside, so Lindahlâs subsequent intervention, knocking Popp down as she tried to punch clear, is neither here nor there. The ref waves play on. 82 min: Marozsan probes down the left, checking back, then turning and whipping a stunning cross onto Poppâs head, ten yards out. Poppâs offside, though. But Lindahl had clattered into Popp, and so thereâs a VAR check for a penalty kick. 80 min: Germany remain strangely flat. Patience is all good and well, but time is running out. They need to raise the tempo. Sweden are looking very comfortable at the moment. 78 min: Jakobsson was clearly listening to Lindahl, and with renewed vigour, nearly sends Sweden into the semis for sure. She dances down the inside-right channel and sashays past Hegering on the edge of the area with great ease. A shotâs battered towards the top right; Schult does very well to parry and gather. 77 min: Weâre off again. Lindahl delivered quite a speech during that break. Only 15 minutes to go and weâre in the semis, would have been the gist of it, Iâll be bound. 75 min: COOLING BREAK. Smart Water all round. Other beverages are available. 73 min: A couple of German corners. Neither delivered convincingly by Marozsan. The two-time winners and current Olympic champions are beginning to run out of ideas. Lindahl hasnât had much to do. 71 min: Blackstenius powers down the left into acres of space left by Doorsoun. For a second, it looks as though sheâs going to make it into the box ahead of Hegering and shoot, but the defender holds her ground and ushers the striker away from goal. Under pressure from Hegering, Blackstenius takes a fresh-air swipe and falls, allowing Schult to gather. 70 min: Germany make their final substitution in the regulation 90 minutes. Theyâll have another if they take the game to extra time. But for now this is it: Schuller is replaced by Oberdorf. 69 min: Itâs all Germany right now ... but itâs sterile domination. All in the middle of the park. When they press forward, a loose pass flies out for a goal kick. Sweden holding their shape very well. 67 min: A free kick for Germany out on the left, and a chance to load the box. Everyone on the edge of the area. Marozsan loops the set piece towards Popp, but Sembrant gets in ahead of the German striker and heads clear. 66 min: Fischerâs back up and about, but it looks as though sheâs going to be subbed. She wants to continue, but on comes Ilestedt. 64 min: A searching cross from the right by Maier causes momentary panic in the Swedish box, but Fischer eventually clears. The Swedish defender then goes down with cramp. On comes the doc. 62 min: The gameâs gone a little bit scrappy. Plenty of loose play in the midfield in the last couple of minutes. Thereâs not been too much of that in this highly entertaining match. 60 min: ... thereâs no action of note. A poor delivery by Dabritz that sails harmlessly over everyone in the box. On the touchline, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg doesnât look best pleased. 59 min: Germany are slowly working their way back into this. Huth dribbles down the left and earns a corner. From which ... 57 min: Lindahl races out of her box to clear a loose ball. She shanks it towards Dabritz, who tries to return it into the unguarded net from 40 yards. Dabritz pulls the effort well left, saving the Sweden keeperâs blushes. Lindahl smiles sheepishly. 55 min: Rolfo will miss the semi if Sweden make it. Sheâs booked for sticking a leg across Magull. She suddenly realises the implications of her actions, and holds her head in despair. 54 min: Blackstenius nearly bulldozes her way past Doorsoun and Hegering. Not quite, but sheâs so dangerous at full pace. 53 min: Popp crosses from the left. Schuller nearly gets a head to it, ten yards out. But not quite. Huth recycles possession on the right and fizzes in a cross that forces Sembrant to concede a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece, but this is better from Germany, who havenât asked Sweden many questions since taking the lead. 51 min: As things stand, Germany wonât be in Japan next year to defend their Olympic title. A huge 40 minutes ahead of us. 50 min: Blackstenius hadnât scored an international goal for a year before her winner against Canada. Now sheâs got two in six days! London buses, huh. Schult meanwhile was appealing for a foul in the build-up - Glas had clipped Magull on the halfway line - but VAR didnât pull it back. Germany had plenty of other chances to stop Sweden, but couldnât do it. Jakobsson powers down the right and stands one up to the far post. Rolfo rises highest and guides a header towards the top right. Schult manages to claw the ball out, but it drops to Blackstenius, who roofs it from six yards. Could Swedenâs 24-year run of misery against Germany come to an end today? 47 min: Marozsan throws herself into a couple of challenges. Clearly not worried about that toe. And weâre off again! A big change, with Germany going for it, replacing Dallmann with Dzsenifer Marozsan. âThoroughly enjoying this World Cup and as a long-time devotee of womenâs football it is so good to see the rise in both floor and ceiling of the game,â writes Hubert OâHearn. âThat said, much like the last menâs World Cup, one change Iâd like to see is a re-seeding after the Group phase. One side of the draw has the three strongest sides in the US, England and the gone-too-soon France. Could Germany, Sweden or the Netherlands win the Cup? Sure, but much like Croatia last year it would be one heck of an upset.â Half-time entertainment. Suzanne Wrack has been zig-zagging around France, staying in hotels with no air con so you donât have to. Hereâs her diary! An entertaining first half comes to a close. The players troop off to get themselves some water and shade. Germany will be happy to hear the whistle, because Sweden were beginning to cause quite a lot of trouble in their final third. Itâs going to be a cracking second half, as this is on a knife-edge. Extra time and penalties a real prospect! 45 min: More bedlam in the German box, as Blackstenius and Rubensson take each other out while trying to latch onto a loose ball. Germany boot it away from danger. Itâs really not clear how Germany kept four clean sheets before this match, because their back line has been all over the place today. 44 min: Simon canât continue. Sheâs replaced by Maier. 43 min: Sweden go long again. Fischer nearly releases Blackstenius, but Doorsoun nicks the ball, passing back to Schult who is forced to hack out for a corner. From the set piece, thereâs some head tennis in the box, then a game of pinball. Germany hack clear, eventually, but not particularly convincingly. The increasingly dangerous Blackstenius bombs down the left and hooks a shot over the bar from a tight angle. 41 min: Simon is off the field having treatment on her knee. Germany, down to ten, go on the attack anyway. Magull thinks sheâs won a corner off Fischer, but the referee awards a goal kick. Simon comes back on. A scrappy couple of minutes. 39 min: Asllani picks up a misplaced Simon pass and drives forward. She rolls a pass upfield, with the intention of releasing Blackstenius again, but Hegering gets a toe to it and guides it back to her keeper. Sweden look like busting the German offside trap every time they go forward. 37 min: Popp rises highest to head the corner clear. Germanyâs captain, who scores every other game on average, is putting in quite the defensive shift today. 36 min: Weâre off again! And Sweden are quickly bearing down on the German goal again. Rolfo, playmaking from deep, rolls a pass down the inside-right channel to release Blackstenius, who looks for the top right from distance. Schult is forced to tip over. Corner. 34 min: COOLING BREAK. Time for isotonic beverages and wet towels around the neck. 32 min: Blackstenius nearly breaks clear down the right, but Popp sticks on her shoulder and forces her to turn back. Sembrant then has a shot from the best part of 40 yards; full marks for ambition. 30 min: The effervescent Magull nearly bustles her way through the centre of the Swedish defence. Sheâs an absolute menace. Sweden donât know how to deal with her. A flick intended for the nearby Huth goes awry. She might have done better by continuing to barge through. 28 min: Gwinn is sprung into space down the right. She cuts back for Dabritz, who has space just inside the box. But a heavy touch means she canât get a shot away. The flag goes up for offside, sparing her blushes, because that was a fine chance. Sweden donât look particularly convincing at the back, though. Quite a few sloppy mistakes. 26 min: A dismal lapse in concentration by Fischer, who lets a rolling ball slip under her foot and allows Huth to skedaddle down the left wing. Huth drifts inside and thinks about shaping a shot towards the top right, but canât find the space. Fischerâs defensive team-mates got her out of hole there. 24 min: Germany have been rattled a little by that goal, which came from nothing. Blackstenius is gifted possession by Popp, and sheâs got options either side. A poorly weighted through ball sails harmlessly through to Schult. âJakobsson is intimidating,â opines Mary Waltz. âShe strides across the pitch like the Night King across the ice.â Game on, right here! A long blooter of a clearance by Sembrant sends Jakobsson clear of a snoozing German back line! Jakobsson powers down the middle, drifts a little to the right and, under pressure from Simon, guides a fine finish across the advancing Schult and into the bottom left! Germany finally concede in this World Cup. 20 min: Jakobsson dribbles down the right and hooks a cross into the mixer. Itâs brought down and cleared by Fischer without too much fuss. Sweden are getting plenty of joy down both wings, but the centres havenât been accurate enough. 18 min: Sweden try to strike back immediately. Some space for Jakobsson down the left. But her cross is easily claimed by Schult. Germany go up the other end, Huth working her way down the right and dinking infield for Schuller, who sends a header straight at Lindahl. What a goal this is! Eriksson gifts the ball to Dabritz, who blazes down the inside-right channel before gliding infield. Dabritz draws a couple of defenders and dinks a cute pass forward for Magull, who is just inside the area, and in a lot of space. Magull flicks the ball up, then swivels and lashes a bicycle kick into the bottom left! Thatâs some finish. 15 min: Space for Schuller down the left. Sweden are on the back foot again. But she runs the ball out of play for a goal kick. 13 min: The first shot in anger, as Jakobsson is released down the inside-left channel by a superb Asllani pass. Schult comes out to close the angle and block. A corner, from which Eriksson heads harmlessly over. But Sweden are right in this now after a slow start. 11 min: Huth zips down the right and briefly threatens to break clear, but eventually meanders down a cul-de-sac and the dangerâs gone. 10 min: Sweden show in attack for the first time, Jakobsson and Aillani taking turns to bother Germany down the right wing. A cross by the latter is fumbled by Schult, but thereâs nobody nearby in blue, so itâs not a desperate mistake. Germany clear. 9 min: Simon, deep and tight on the left touchline, rolls a gorgeous diagonal pass towards Huth, taking three Swedes out of the game and nearly releasing her team-mate into the area. Huth canât quite shake off Glas, though, and sheâs forced to check back. What a pass, though. 7 min: Germany are first to everything right now. Dabritz strides towards the Swedish box and falls backwards while taking a shot. Lindahl brings it in. Dabritz had Magull in quite a bit of space to her left then; perhaps shooting wasnât the best option. 6 min: Magull looks for the top-left corner. She doesnât get anywhere near it, and itâs an easy gather for Lindahl. 5 min: Dallmann wins the ball in the middle of the park with a crunching tackle on Seger. She shuttles the ball forward for Magull, who backflicks to Dabritz on the edge of the box. Sheâs crudely checked, and thatâs a free kick in a very dangerous position, just to the left of the D. 4 min: Itâd been a quiet start on the pitch too, but suddenly Dabritz rolls a pass down the left for Simon, who earns the first corner of the match. From the set piece, Popp rises at the far post and sends a soft header into the arms of Lindahl. 2 min: An eerie quiet. Itâs almost as though the crowd donât want to deplete their energy levels too soon in this heat. Eventually thereâs a ripple of applause and everyone gets going. And weâre off! Germany get the party started, and stroke it around the back awhile. Everyone gets a touch. The teams are out! Germany wear their famous white (with Atari Breakout stripes) while Sweden are in second-choice blue. Both anthems are proudly played, sung and fully respected with warm applause from all four corners of the stadium. Followers of a certain menâs team who also play in white, please take note. Hands are clapped, coins are tossed, pennants are exchanged. Weâll be off in a hot minute! This match is a repeat of the 2003 final. Relive all the German joy and Swedish heartache here, as Nia KÃ¼nzerâs golden header in Carson, California secured Die Nationalelfâs first World Cup. The winner of this match will play the Netherlands on Wednesday evening. The Dutch booked their place in the semi-finals - and next yearâs Olympics - by seeing off Italy. Vivianne Miedema and Stefanie van der Gragt did the business with second-half headers. Kieran Pender was at the Stade du Hainaut; his report is a mere click away. Itâs very warm indeed in Guardian Towers Rennes. Roazhon Park is like an oven, a cauldron, a tandoor. Itâs 31Â°C, or 88Â°F in the old money. During their pre-match exercises, players have cooled down by standing in the spray of the pitch sprinklers. There will be drinks breaks during the match. Both teams have been provided with a portable air-conditioning unit in their dressing rooms. Theyâll be chugging away like billy-o as we speak. Phew, what a scorcher! Dzsenifer Marozsan doesnât make the Germany starting XI. But she will be on the bench with a view to coming on if required, as Martina Voss-Tecklenburg suggested yesterday. Voss-Tecklenburg makes two changes to the XI sent out against Nigeria in the last round. Carolin Simon replaces Verena Schweers at left-back, while Linda Dallmann comes in for Melanie Leupolz in the centre of midfield. Sweden coach Peter Gerhardsson names the same team that began the match against Canada. And heâs refusing to worry about his countryâs wretched run against the Germans. âItâs history. We have new players now.â Germany: Schult, Gwinn, Doorsoun, Hegering, Simon, Dabritz, Dallmann, Magull, Huth, Popp, Schuller. Subs: Benkarth, Hendrich, Maier, Oberdorf, Goessling, Marozsan, Elsig, Schweers, Leupolz, Buhl, Knaak, Frohms. Sweden: Lindahl, Glas, Fischer, Sembrant, Eriksson, Rubensson, Asllani, Seger, Jakobsson, Blackstenius, Rolfo. Subs: Faik, Andersson, Janogy, Hurtig, Ilestedt, Roddar, Bjorn, Zigiotti Olme, Anvegard, Larsson, Schough, Musovic. Referee: Stephanie Frappart (Paris). Sweden havenât beaten Germany at a major tournament for nearly a quarter of a century. In 1995, as hosts of the World Cup, they triumphed 3-2 in a sensational group encounter, coming back from two down at half time thanks to a couple of goals from Malin Andersson and one from the legendary Pia Sundhage. At this point in history, they were very much the bosses of Germany, having also beaten then 4-0 in the third-place play-off at the inaugural World Cup four years earlier. But the tables have since turned dramatically. The two countries met again in the 2003 final, Nia KÃ¼nzer scoring a golden goal for the Germans. Subsequently, whenever the Swedes have come up against Germany while chasing the big prizes, theyâve been sent packing, whether itâs been the Olympics, the Euros or the World Cup. Last time round, in Canada, the Germans were 4-1 victors in the round of 16. This is a lop-sided rivalry. Thereâs always hope in football, though. The Swedes are on a high after an impressive win over Canada, while Germany, by their own lofty standards, have yet to find top gear at this tournament. A strange thing to say about a team who have won all their games and are yet to concede a goal, but there it is. They will be welcoming back the influential Dzsenifer Marozsan from injury, however. Sheâs certain to play some part, whether from the start or coming off the bench, and will send a shiver down Swedish spines after her match-winning contribution in the 2016 Olympic final. So itâs all set up nicely. A place in the semi-final is up for grabs, with qualification for next yearâs Olympics thrown in. Weâre playing for big stakes; this promises to be a cracker. Itâs the quarter final of the World Cup. Itâs very hot. Itâs on! Kick off: 5.30pm BST, 6.30pm local.",0,0,2.2369179725646973,-2.3440725803375244,0.010140852873859862

4650,498,2019-06-30 09:00:13,"The week in theatre: The Hunt; Present Laughter; The Damned â review. It is 15 years since the Almeida staged Festen, based on Thomas Vinterbergâs film about family trauma and child abuse. I have never forgotten its gloom and glimmer, its slow disclosure and psychological stranglehold. Now the theatre revisits that territory. David Farr has adapted Vinterbergâs and Tobias Lindholmâs 2012 film The Hunt (Jagten), in which a school teacher is wrongly accused of sexually abusing a young girl. In Rupert Gooldâs staging the result is electric. You can tell The Hunt will carry conviction from the moment Michele Austin, lights still up, welcomes the audience to her infant school. Her bustling geniality is so authentic that she might be part of the Almeida backstage team. You can see immediately some of the playâs shifting moods, the disturbing preoccupations in Es Devlinâs magnificent design. A dinky little house â simple as a childâs drawing or a garden shed â is perched on a revolve. In darkness it is impenetrable: this is a play about secrets that continually questions whether we can ever know each other. When irradiated with Neil Austinâs lighting (sometimes unsparingly white, sometimes murky), it becomes transparent and rapidly changing: it is a place of wistful innocence, where a small girl perches alone; an angry box in which the members of a hunting lodge roar and stamp; a claustrophobic container for a village; a display case for wounded creatures. Adam Corkâs sound design is threaded through the action, like an echo of anxiety. There is a strong tradition of plays about false (or possibly false) accusations brought by children against figures in authority â and the destruction they bring. Lillian Hellmanâs The Childrenâs Hour is also set in a school; Arthur Millerâs The Crucible has always drawn strength from being considered a picture of McCarthyism. Timing gives The Hunt a particular skewering interest. Staged when we have been retraining ourselves to hear the previously disregarded voices of children and women bullied by men in power, the play twists the expectations and sympathy of spectators. It is rare to see child performers of such natural assurance as â on press night â George Nearn Stuart and Taya Tower: he wild and open, she contained and secretive. They encapsulate the two extremes of temperament in the play â and the damage wrought by their parents. Poppy Miller is particularly distressing as a distracted, wilful mother. And in the central role â of a man who has imprinted on his spirit his own fatherâs love of a solitary life spent on Arctic ships â Tobias Menzies is extraordinary: clenched, calm and unknowable. So what is the transporting feature of Matthew Warchusâs gleaming, bound-for-success production of Present Laughter? The obvious answer is Andrew Scott, proving his wonderful elasticity as an actor. Think of his Hamlet, convulsed with emotion, and of his fugitive performance in The Dazzle â quite apart from his Sherlock-ing and his unholy success in Fleabag. Look at him in the part that NoÃ«l Coward wrote for himself: the adored and flattered matinee idol Garry Essendine, doyen of the dressing gown. Essendine may be all posture and persiflage, but he also delivers a kind of truth. His whole point is overdoing it â âWhere would you be,â he asks his friends and hangers-on, âif I didnât show off?â Scott shows off superbly: his arms sweep widely; he swoops on a bon mot like a bird of prey; he spins on the spot. He is also delicate: brushing his forehead at the dread thought of a future toupe. There is more, though, to this triumph than great Scott. By a clever tweaking of gender in one of the satellite couples, Essendine becomes evidently a lover of men. The play gains in feeling as a consequence, with the ripple of an extra secret. You would think that few stage embraces would be surprising these days, but when Essendine clinches with a male visitor (the two of them struggling out of evening wear in a kind of dance) a woman in the audience gasped loudly. Warchus should employ her to exclaim at each performance â she added to the drama. The sourness, or melancholy, of the ending â in which tradition is turned on its head as Essendine pleads with the wife from whom he is separated not to return to him â is underlined, as the couple sit apart in the sinking light. Cowardâs original title was âSweet Sorrowâ. There is another winner too: Coward. Even his most languid lines â âThereâs something awfully sad about happinessâ â ring out: you are hit by the drilling intelligence behind the drawl. Scott delivers, with precision and force, a terrific anti-Sturm und Drang speech about people ensnared in romantic lies. Warchusâs production lets all this breathe, while also neatly emphasising the French farce element â with awkward stopovers continually threatening to burst out behind closed doors. There are a few exclamation marks too many. Rob Howellâs blazingly royal blue set, with its amazed diagonals, over-clobbers the art deco. But Indira Varma beautifully relishes her nonchalant contempt; Sophie Thompson is a vocal escalator, going from squeaking to husky contralto in a comic sentence. Luke Thallon is terrifyingly springy as an avid avant garde dramatist. Present Laughter looks like future West End. Ivo van Hove has adapted four of Luchino Viscontiâs screenplays for the stage. His ComÃ©die FranÃ§aise production of The Damned, full of panache and of rhetoric, looks less like a reimagining than a defiance of the odds. I was always aware â as I wasnât in Gooldâs staging of The Hunt â of a director bouncing off a movie. The story of a factory-owning family in 1930s Germany who are variously converted to and destroyed by Nazism is rendered in a series of arresting images but with little momentum. Naked chaps slide erotically through soapy water. Buckets of blood are flung over bodies. Black-and-white documentary film â of the burning of the Reichstag, of munitions factories, of the faces of men and women in Dachau â runs in the background; at one side of the stage a rank of coffins are gradually filled by the cast. The most truly memorable moment shows a woman tarred and feathered going to her wedding, looking like a gull plucked from an oil-choked ocean. Patrolling cameras â a regular Van Hove device â bring fragments of activity into closeup. Every now and then there is a turning of the tables as the cameras scan the audience, implicating us in the action. They do so most obviously when we are instructed that we need to observe and must never forget. Absolutely right of course, but the parallel looks confected here.

4651,497,2019-06-30 12:11:01,"Dinghy sailors close in on Great Britain circumnavigation record. They have braved gale-force winds, dodged huge container ships and suffered vivid hallucinations prompted by sleep deprivation but two hardy adventurers are on the brink of becoming the first to circumnavigate Great Britain non-stop and unassisted in a tiny open sailing dinghy. Will Hodshon, 42, and Rich Mitchell, 44, will have spent 16 days at sea when they arrive back in Devon early on Monday onboard a Wayfarer dinghy that is a mere 4.9 metres (16ft) long. Once they have stretched their legs and had showers and a few square meals, the lifelong friends will apply to Guinness World Records to go into the history books as the first to complete the feat, which requires a combination of brilliant sailing ability and a daredevil attitude. Mitchell said they had had some wonderful days. âThere have been moments when weâve had perfect sailing conditions. Weâve seen minke whales, hundreds of seals and dolphins have accompanied us for hours at a time trying to splash us.â But there have also been some scary moments, he said. âWeâve had a few days of big winds and waves and in those conditions you canât sleep at all. Will has been hearing the odd voice or two and Iâve been hallucinating a bit. Sleep deprivation has been the worst â weâve fallen asleep on watch a number of times. Sometimes the sailing is very challenging. You canât get off the boat when you feel youâve had enough. You just have to carry on with it.â The British-designed Wayfarer is a popular family day-boat, though its seaworthiness means that it can be relied upon in open waters. However, it is not a simple vessel to sail, staying upright thanks to a combination of careful distribution of the crewâs bodyweight and constant trimming or adjustment of the sails. The Wayfarer Hodshon and Mitchell have voyaged in, Nipegegi â pronounced nippy gee-gee â is built of mahogany and is 60 years old. It was bought at the 1959 London Boat Show by Hodshonâs grandfather, Bill Hodshon. Its name is made up of the first two letters of the names of the adventurerâs uncle, father and two aunts: Nick, Penny, Geoff and Gill. Hodshon, a marine geoscientist from Wiltshire, said: âThree times weâve been in near gale-force or gale-force winds. When that happens at night itâs really scary. In the North Sea when we were at our furthest point out â about 60 miles â we had already been going hard into the wind for a day and a half. We were wet and cold already. This wind came in, we were worried, I didnât know how we were going to make it. We took it an hour at a time and eventually got through.â The pair were inspired by another circumnavigation of Great Britain in 2014 when the sailors Jeremy Warren and Phil Kirk ventured around the coast in just over a month. But they stopped, which Hodshon and Mitchell decided not to. âWe havenât touched dry land at all,â said Mitchell, a fisheries expert from Fort William in the Scottish Highlands. âWeâve seen it and hankered after it â and the odd pub weâve passed.â One of his favourite legs was the North Sea. âIâve known it as a brown and cold and miserable and cold place,â he said. âBut one of the days there was a beautiful, sunny day. The sea was like glass, not a ripple. That changed my whole perception of what the North Sea is.â Hodshon said he preferred sailing through the islands of western Scotland with fantastic views of hills and mountains. But there has been little disagreement onboard. âWe already knew most things about each other but itâs a very small boat,â said Mitchell. âThereâs nothing left to hide from each other. And we didnât run out of conversation. âPeople think theyâd get bored. Each day flies by â setting the sails, planning the next meal, planning for the toilet break. Thereâs almost not enough time in the day. Weâve never been bored.â The pair have been raising money for charities including the lifeboat charity the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and Surfers Against Sewage. They took with them enough freeze-dried food to last 30 days so food has not been a problem. âWeâve got enough to go around again,â said Hodshon. âBut we arenât going to.â",0,0,2.220527410507202,-2.335791826248169,0.010391520663081778

4691,496,2019-07-02 06:00:37,"The rise of the CEO as social justice warrior | Jill Priluck. On the heels of JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, which both divested from private prisons in March, Bank of America recently announced that it will no longer finance the operations of prisons and detention centers. While the bank has cited political disagreement as the reason for the divestment, its decision to sever ties comes after a Miami Herald article revealed that Bank of America had provided a $380m loan and a $75m credit line to Caliburn, operator of a facility that houses separated migrant children. Bank of America claimed the decision was down to the prison industryâs lack of âneededâ criminal justice and immigration reforms, though it didnât elaborate. But itâs obvious bad PR was a factor. Corporations have belatedly developed something approximating a social conscience. Appleâs Tim Cook has called the Trump administrationâs border policies âinhumaneâ and urged it to stop. JP Morganâs Jamie Dimon criticized the policy in an email to employees and wrote that his âheart goes out to the impacted familiesâ. Goldman Sachsâ Lloyd Blankfein has called the situation âheart-rendingâ. These CEOs are taking a stand on social issues when elected Republican officials canât â or wonât. But even though these corporate liberal gestures are better than nothing, and sometimes even effective, they arenât necessarily altruistic. CEOs and companies attach themselves to ideas and policies that elevate their economic or moral status â in corporate Americaâs case, policies that generate profits or, at least, donât get in the way of generating profits. Elite companies thrive by having their own cultures and thought-bubbles that ripple throughout the firm. Opposing administration policies that are antithetical to these values increases a firmâs power and cachet. As a result, entities such as Apple and Amazon transform into mini fiefdoms that dictate the political sensibilities of not only their employees, clients and those in their sphere, but sometimes the public at large. When Trump was elected in 2016, corporate America became a lot more activist. Amazon, Microsoft and other firms provided impact data in support of the Washington state lawsuit against the Muslim ban. Companies renewed their commitments to fighting climate change in the wake of dismantled EPA rules. Of course, in opposing the travel ban, firms had a self-serving need: their desire for skilled labor. In the case of opposition to border policies, firms had a different self-serving need: a demand for a moral stand either because it suited the culture of the firm or staved off a public relations mishap. According to a 2019 study, The Politics of CEOs, CEOs influence political spending at their firms and gain stature from their image as thought leaders with expertise and authority on policy issues. They also have tools to influence the political process, as Citizens United made it legal for corporations to make unlimited campaign expenditures. A 2018 Edelman survey found that 64% of the public believes CEOs âshould take the lead on change rather than waiting for the government to impose itâ, and 84% believes that CEOs should inform and shape ongoing policy debates. The outcry over the migrants didnât change public policy. But it raised the profiles of CEOs whose jobs depend on preserving their public image or risking ouster. As Bank of Americaâs CEO, Brian Moynihan, has said, a CEOâs job description now includes driving what the CEO thinks is right. But what the CEO thinks is right is usually based on hours of vetting talking points to ensure the message matches the mission â and doesnât disturb net profits. Jill Priluckâs reporting and analysis has appeared in the New Yorker, Slate, Reuters and elsewhere",0,0,2.330044984817505,-2.5195705890655518,0.007770533501135883
4692,495,2019-07-02 17:47:29,"Would the last Tory left in Northern Ireland please turn out the lights? | John Crace. It feels longer than 10 days. Much longer. With the Conservative leadership hustings into their second week, the feeling of existential despair now feels total. What novelty there might once have been has long since worn off. Even Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson can barely keep their eyes open as they stumble their way through tired scripts. There is no sense of edge or danger. Of the next prime minister being tested. Just a continuing beauty parade of the incompetent and the inadequate. Lip service to democracy. There was barely a ripple of applause for the arrival of Hunt in Belfast. Not just because there wasnât much interest in Ken doll â there was no greater enthusiasm for the appearance of Johnson later â but also because there are only 500 Tory members in Northern Ireland and most of them had better things to do with their life than turn up for something entirely meaningless. The others had merely come for the tea and biscuits. Overnight, Hunt seemed to have forgotten his 10-point Colonel Kurtz no-deal action plan and drifted back into his more familiar role of Barbieâs squeeze. His stump speech was delivered with all the passion of a man on heavy medication. Halfway through, he seemed to vaguely remember he was in Northern Ireland and dropped in a reference to Game of Thrones. Which is the one thing about Northern Ireland that people who donât give a toss about Northern Ireland actually know. âI really care about â¦ um â¦ er â¦ Northern Ireland,â he said. Though not the 56% of the country who had voted remain in the EU referendum. Instead, Ken was totally focused on giving Northern Ireland something it really didnât want. The backstop had to go, he insisted. But luckily, in Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands, he had two IT wizards who had come up with a technological solution that would keep the border frictionless. The MC for the day, the radio presenter Iain Dale, briefly woke up to point out that even by the standards of this leadership contest, this was a lie too far. âHmm,â Ken grumbled. It was typical of the EU to deny that something that didnât exist actually didnât exist. Clearly bored, Dale then asked Hunt which Game of Thrones character he most identified with. âI know itâs a cliche,â Ken smiled coyly. âBut itâs Jon Snow.â Because that was the only character he could name. So he probably had no idea he had chosen the one who ends up in exile after killing the blonde psychopath who was about to destroy the world. The chronicle of a death foretold. Audience questions quickly petered out as Ken promised to spend billions of pounds he didnât have on problems he didnât understand, and though he didnât want a no-deal Brexit, heâd do it anyway â just for the hell of it â if Johnny Foreigner didnât appreciate his entrepreneurial skills. By the end, everyone had given up and had taken to asking him about his favourite colour and whether he preferred dogs to cats. Just to fill time. Still, at least Ken had some idea of where he was. Which was more than could be said for Johnson, who gave one of his laziest performances yet. Thereâs a fine line between being utterly bland to avoid screwing up and not appearing to give a shit. And Boris was well the wrong side of it. Good evening, Glasgow! When asked to explain the continuing failure of the power-sharing executive in Stormont, he made Karen Bradley seem like Mo Mowlam. When asked to talk about Game of Thrones, he burbled on about Star Wars. Which had been filmed in the Republic of Ireland. It was almost as if he was going out of his way to cause offence. Yes, heâd happily turn parts of Northern Ireland into a tax-free centre for smuggling. Though he couldnât say what ports might qualify. And heâd build the bridge between Scotland and Ireland that every civil engineer said was impossible to build. There was no detail over which he had the slightest grasp. No wonder he struggles to remember how many children he has. Piffle, paffle, wiffle, waffle, Johnson ad-libbed. Everyone just ought to stop being so glum. A no-deal Brexit was nothing to be worried about. The negative claims being made were being wildly overdone. Just believe. By now, Boris had lost the entire room, as everyone had tuned into Philip Hammondâs final outing as chancellor at Treasury questions. Freewheelinâ Phil had been determined to go down fighting. Ken and Boris were complete fantasists, he shrugged. A no-deal departure would cost Â£95bn minimum. Money we didnât have. And heâd happily vote with Labour to prevent them from bankrupting the country. Johnson was still rambling when Dale cut him short. âLetâs wrap this thing up,â he said. Enough was enough. Best to end the embarrassment. Would the last Tory left in Northern Ireland please turn out the lights?",0,0,2.1652023792266846,-2.18005108833313,0.01280219906358955

4710,494,2019-07-04 04:30:33,"Country diary: beneath the gin-clear waters of the Test. Rising near Ashe in Hampshire and flowing for around 40 miles before converging with the Itchen, the Test supports a rich diversity of aquatic life. More than 12 species of freshwater fish inhabit its fast-flowing, gin-clear waters, from tiny minnows to monster pike, but this chalk stream is world renowned for its wild salmonids â trout, salmon and grayling. Crossing the river, I look down from the bridge and notice a hover of seven mature brown trout (Salmo trutta) languidly finning midstream. They are beauties, 30 to 40 centimetres in length, with sleek torpedo-shaped bodies. Their brassy flanks are speckled with dark brown spots, each spot surrounded by a pale silver halo. Though there are a few medium olives (Baetis vernus) dancing above the water in first faltering flight, the mayfly hatch has all but finished. After the past two months gorging on their emergent subimagos and imagos (the sub-adult and mature forms of these ethereal insects), the trout have changed their diet and are now occupying âfeeding liesâ, places in the river where converging currents slow and funnel food into a concentrated area. The trout effortlessly hold their position in the water column, their pectoral fins jutting out like wings, their bodies fluttering like flags on the breeze, as they wait to intercept larvae, nymphs and shrimps. Every so often a terrestrial insect falls from the overhanging weeping willows, provoking a fish to punctuate the surface with a ripple of concentric circles as it slurps down its drowning prey. I wander further along the bank and notice a five-inch parr being swept downstream. The immature fish is recognisable as a brown trout but has distinctive smudgy fingerprint patterning, known as parr marks, along its sides. As it flicks its tail and eases into the shallows to seek the cover of a trailing bed of water-crowfoot (Ranunculus sp.), a second parr darts out to defend its territory. The pair face off, the resident fish gaping its mouth and flaring its gills. There is a flash of sunlight on scales as a chase ensues, the defender driving the interloper into deeper water where it pivots and, fighting the flow, attempts to swim back upstream.",0,0,2.254392147064209,-2.3337788581848145,0.010069028323491498
4711,493,2019-07-04 20:10:15,"Australia chase down 218 to beat England in second ODI of Women's Ashes â as it happened. So, England go into the third and final ODI with all the pressure and none of the points. Pluses - their batting at the tail can only get better, they lost 6-34 at the end, and Tammy Beaumont should be buzzing with that first Ashes hundred. Australia are proving that, surprise, surprise, theyâre a force to be reckoned with, and theyâre only warming up. Thanks for your emails, especially those of you clocking in during the night hours. Good night! Meg Lanning: âIt was about being disciplined and composed under pressure and I thought Ellyse Perry batted really well and so did Beth Mooney at the end.â And the player of the match is ... Delissa Kimmince for her career best five for 26. Heather Knight: âI think it was a frustrating one. I thought Tammy played outstandingly on a slow wicket, and if weâd had someone whoâd stayed with her weâd have pushed it up to 250 and beyond. We tried to put a bit of pressure on them with the ball and we did outstandingly well taking early wickets, but those two at the end batted well. We need to be a bit smarter with the bat. Weâre going to have to debrief quite quickly and turn it around very quickly.â A clinical Australian performance. England can be grateful to a wonderful century by Tammy Beaumont, her first against Australia, which propped up the batting and deserved more. With the ball, England didnât quite have the incisiveness against the quality of Perry, Mooney, Haynes and Lanning. The batting line-up that never ends. Australia have now won the first two ODI matches, which gives them a 4-0 lead in the series. One ODI, a Test and the T20s to go. Next? Canterbury on Sunday. With 28 balls spare.Not flawless, but efficient, and clever. 45th over: Australia 215-6 (Jonassen 29, Mooney 42) Cross comes back and Mooney drives her up and gloriously over extra cover. The crowd pack up their picnics and wander away. Australia need three to win off five overs. 44th over: Australia 208-6 (Jonassen 29, Mooney 36) Ecclestone bravely throws it up. Australia potter through for a couple of singles. And the fifty stand comes up. Australia need ten to win. Ah Graham. Hello!! Doesnât seem to be working out. How can Australia fail? Brunt yelling âchunderâ before every delivery? By the way, if Freddie Truman was your dadâs childhood hero â¦ I am older by a generation. I hope we win the test and the T20s, of course. How come so few emails? It is very exciting â¦ well it was until Australia came back after being substituted by Austria. We were in with a shout. I donât know what everyoneâs doing. Itâs been fun. Thank you my loyal emailers. WHERE ARE YOU PEOPLE? 43rd over: Australia 206-6 (Jonassen 28, Mooney 35) Katherine Brunt is the last throw of the dice. She stops the flow of boundaries, but Australia jog through for four singles. Anyone got a miracle up their sleeve? Australia need 12 from 41 balls. 42nd over: Australia 202-6 (Jonassen 26, Mooney 33) Mooney top-edges Ecclestoneâs first ball but it descends between the clutching fingers of three fielders. Jonassen goes for a similar shot next ball, but executes it much better and it soars one bounce over long on to the rope. A shake of singles and Australia are cruising now. They need 16 from 48 balls. 41st over: Australia 195-6 (Jonassen 21, Mooney 31) Marsh bowls a more tidy over, and though the ball is hitting the fielders now, Australia still run eager singles. Five from the over, no risks, no bother. Australia need 23 from 54 balls. 40th over: Australia 190-6 (Jonassen 19, Mooney 28) Weâre back to dibble-dabble strokes from Australia as Shrubsole regains some authority. Just two off the over. Australia need 28 from 60 balls and it all depends if Australia make the same hash of the end of their innings as England did. 39th over: Australia 188-6 (Jonassen 18, Mooney 27) A pricey over from Laura Marsh - eleven off it. Mooney has itchy feet and lofts her up and over extra cover and through the off side. Australia need 30 off 66 balls. 38th over: Australia 177-6 (Jonassen 12, Mooney 22) A ruddy-faced Shrubsole thunders in. Sheâs been the most expensive of the bunch, but has a Bothamesque ability to take wickets from both brilliance and bathos. Mooney slog-sweeps her for four, then a handful of singles. Australia need 41 off 72 balls. 37th over: Australia 169-6 (Jonassen 10, Mooney 16) Two fours from Sophie Ecclestoneâs over as she strays uncharacteristically wild. A little wide and Jonassen directs her past third man, then again through the covers. 36th over: Australia 159-6 (Jonassen 1, Mooney 15) An intriguing game now, as the swingometer inches over from Australia to England. A cross-seamed tortoise-paced ball from Shrubsole bowls Gardener, who was attempting to drive her. Big relief there for Shrubsole who dropped her in the previous over. 35th over: Australia 155-5 (Gardener 12, Mooney 13) A good over for Australia. Ecclestone still causing problems but two boundaries, one awkward, ugly, four between midwicket and mid-on, and a gorgeous extra-cover drive. 34th over: Australia 146-5 (Gardener 8, Mooney 8) Shrubsole bowls full and on the stumps, Gardener whips her for four. Then, a howler. Gardener pushes back at Shrubsole who somehow lets the ball fall through her fingers. She gets a consoling pat from Knight and Jones but is mouthdownturningly miserable about that. 33rd over: Australia 140-5 (Gardener 2, Mooney 8) Brunt marches with intent. She does everything with intent. Gardner watches carefully, showing the face of her bat. She swings round at the last ball of the over, a shorter ball, which she pulls down for a single. 32nd over: Australia 138-5 (Gardener 1, Mooney 8) The breakthrough of the match for England. It feels like it is advantage England now At 31.3 overs (the fall of the wicket) England were 144-4; Australia were 136-5. Swings and roundabouts. A terrible wide nothing that Perry stands still to, stretches for, and gets the lightest of touches on. Even Shrubsole looks embarrassed. But that is a vital breakthrough for England - Perry was in sparkling form. 31st over: Australia 132-4 ( Perry 58, Mooney 7) A ripple of applause as Katherine Brunt serves her appointed time prowling in the deep and is thrown the ball again. Six off the over, one a leg-side loosener that Perry helps on its way to the boundary. Thanks vey much Australia need 86 from 19 overs at 4.25. 30th over: Australia 126-4 ( Perry 53, Mooney 6) Thatâs a super shot by Perry to bring up her fifty. She squared up and just pinged the ball past mid-on, straight and hard. She raises her bat and smiles, blond ponytail poking out of the back of her helmet. That hundred came from 72 balls, and included seven fours. 29th over: Australia 119-4 ( Perry 48, Mooney 4) England keeping Perry waiting for her fifty. Three singles off Marshâs over, including an inelegant sweep by Mooney that catches the glove and might have been a possible run-out had the throw hit. 28th over: Australia 116-4 ( Perry 47, Mooney 2) Two off Crossâs over and three emails! Untold riches. Oh: they all say the same thing - I have Austria playing in the Ashes. Thanks Jordan, Nick and Martin! 27th over: Austria 114-4 ( Perry 46, Mooney 1) A vital wicket there for Marsh, but Haynes is replaced by another left hander in Mooney. This Australian batting line-up is long but, number by number, England are getting there. The breakthrough England needed. A leading edge back to the delighted bowler and England reap the rewards for frustrating Haynes. A partnership with Perry of 53. 26th over: Austria 110-3 ( Perry 44, Haynes 29) The sun has disappeared now at Grace Road and the floodlights are on, a nonsensical rule means they have to be switched on for the second innings, no ifs, no buts. In England in midsummer? Seems daft not to be able to use your initiative, and a terrible waste of electricity. Just two off that Cross over. Tick, tock. Katherine Brunt was off the field for about half an hour so wonât be able to bowl again till about quarter to eight. Graham writes again: Everyone is younger than me. But in case you do not know the word âchunder,â it is a peculiarly Aussie term popularised by Barry Humphries in his Private Eye cartoon Barry McKenzie. Origins are earlier, but it is a euphemism for the contents of ones stomach after a calamitous regurgitation. Sorry for lowering the tone. Banana is a good call. I bet Iâm older than you. Chunder is a great word. But Iâm not sure vomit yellow is quite fair.... 25th over: Austria 110-3 ( Perry 44, Haynes 29) Laura Marsh, red soled shoes, flights it and Haynes gets in a tangle, pads over boots. Just a couple from that one. Nice over. 24th over: Austria 108-3 ( Perry 40, Haynes 29) Sciver has bowled well but with the odd loose ball every over. And it happens again. A short one that Perry sends dismissively on its way. And Australia are half way to their target, after 24 overs. 23rd over: Austria 102-3 ( Perry 36, Haynes 29) Haynes squints through the bars of her helmet at Laura Marsh, watches, watches, then takes two steps down the pitch and drives just to the side of the stumps for four. She smiles, pleased. And so she should be. Gorgeous. 22nd over: Austria 94-3 ( Perry 34, Haynes 23) Nat Sciver, hair in a bun, complete action, scampers in . Her second ball is a shorter ball and Haynes deposits it through midwicket for four. A few more scrambled runs and Australia are ticking over. 21st over: Austria 86-3 ( Perry 32, Haynes 17). And England keep it tight again, just one off Marshâs over. Something will give soon, what will it be? And there is Katherine Brunt back on the field. Phew! 20th over: Austria 85-3 ( Perry 31, Haynes 17) Nat Sciver, who looks like the type of schoolgirl who was good at everything AND nice, takes the ball. Full of energy, but Perryâs eyes light up to her second ball and sends it spinning back through the covers for four. And off the pitch, we see Katherine Brunt in a yellow bib, perhaps banana, galloping from side to side. The odd grimace, but itâs obviously not too bad. Perhaps a twisted ankle? (aside: donât trust me, Iâm not a doctor). 19th over: Austria 79-3 ( Perry 26, Haynes 16) Ah Rachael Haynes, that was gorgeous. A drive off Marsh through mid off for four. The sublime is nearly followed by the ridiculous as Perry and Haynes try to run each other out. But the England throw wasnât accurate enough to milk their mistakes. 18th over: Austria 74-3 ( Perry 25, Haynes 10) Just two off Ecclestoneâs over as Australia struggle to pin point the boundary. Patient? Impatient? We shall see. 17th over: Austria 72-3 ( Perry 25, Haynes 10) Laura Marsh, bowling in sunnies. Not Chris Gayle wide boy sunnies, just your bog standard sporty numbers. Haynes looks desperate to twinkle down the pitch but restrains herself. A good over apart from when she strays a little leg side. Tim Robinson, looking grizzled, signals wide. 16th over: Austria 71-3 ( Perry 25, Haynes 10) Long shadows stretching over the field as Ecclestone bowls her fourth over. Sheâs quick through these overs - have some compassion Sophie! Rachel Haynes jigs forward and lifts her high and handsome for six. And thatâs drinks. 15th over: Austria 62-3 ( Perry 24, Haynes 2) Laura Marsh comes on where Brunt came off and Australia only scuttle through for a couple. England will desperately miss Brunt, who bowled four overs, taking one for 16 before she went off. If she doesnât come back, England will have to somehow muddle through, a bowler down. 14th over: Australia 61-3 ( Perry 24, Haynes 1) Just two from Ecclestoneâs over. Lovely stuff. 13th over: Australia 59-3 ( Perry 23, Haynes o) Brunt limps off with the strength and conditioning coach on one arm and the physio on the other. Hope sheâll be ok. She was walking gingerly, but walking. A great wicket though, a super ball, and Lanning was done over by the speed - or lack of it. The average partnership between Perry and Lanning before today was a hundred. Not anymore! A slower ball gets the gun! Lanning gets an edge and the bails go flying. But Brunt goes down flat on the ground. This doesnât look good. An ankle? Hamstring? 12th over: Australia 56-2 ( Perry 21, Lanning 17) Ecclesstone bowls with a tangle of arms, as if sheâs using one of those old fashioned hand-whisks with a turning circle. She flights it, tempting the bats, who are watchful. Just a couple of singles from the over 11th over: Australia 54-2 ( Perry 20, Lanning 16) Brunt and England keep it tight, frustrating Perry and Lanning who like to deal in boundaries. I just get the feeling theyâre going to want to hit out soon. 10th over: Australia 51-2 ( Perry 19, Lanning 14) Perry is watchful as Knight turns to Ecclestone. Sheâs on her toes straight away, but is unable to get her away. Ecclestone in sunglasses, her long ponytail dancing down her back, has a maiden to start. End of the powerplay. 9th over: Australia 51-2 ( Perry 19, Lanning 14) A super over from Brunt. Dot to dot from one to four. Then a wide. Then Perry angles her bat and guides the ball into the offside and the Aussies scamper through for two quick and determined singles. Thatâs the fifty up at the close of the ninth over. Abhijato Sensarma again: âOf course we can! As a matter of fact, in my entire club cricket career, the strongest and most skilled all-rounder who attended our coaching was a girl (she was a classical runner between the wickets too!) I remain in awe of her till this day, and cite this song as a point of reference to the legendary sheâs... Cheers gals, you rock!â Thanks Abhijato! 8th over: Australia 48-2 ( Perry 19, Lanning 12) Perry swings at Crossâs first ball and misses. Point to Cross. Then she dollies up a half volley and Perry needs little temptation and it crosses the rope with a twang. Banana or gold, Perry is class. 7th over: Australia 44-2 ( Perry 15, Lanning 12) Heather Knight scratches her cap and throws the ball to Katherine Brunt who marches with military precision to her mark. But Perry doffs her cap to no-one, nudging the first ball down to the boundary where Laura Marsh just fails to cut it off. OB Jato is in poetic mode: âVague drives are the death of precision, yet the birth of simultaneous lazy excellence and frustration depending on whether the concerned individual pulls off the shot or not.â A metaphor for life OB? 6th over: Australia 37-2 ( Perry 10, Lanning 10) England struggling to keep Australia from bubbling over here. Another four from Lanning screams âlook at meâ 5th over: Australia 32-2 ( Perry 6, Lanning 9) Now Lanning gets in on the act, a square drive, lovely, through the covers, brmmm, brmmm, for four. Abhijato Sensarma writes in with An ode to all the batsmen Iâve ever batted with: âI shouldnât call you in this daze/ Yeah this flickâs made me brave/ The pitch is still the comfort, the chase/ I shouldnât call you in this daze âCause I know that this is not the only one/ Which is tryna be this partnershipâs only one/ Donât want you in the danger zone but out of sight/ If you let this be our only one/ There will never be a lonely run/ I canât go on hoping the fielder doesnât throw with his right Stand by/ Thereâs a million other singles on offer tonight/ You know I could have a safe one if I like/ Yeah you ainât gonâ run to save me/ Thatâs no lie/ I canât stay on/ Stand By! (The âohâs featured in the original songâs chorus are to be replaced by the quintessential club cricketerâs âNo! No! No!â while denying a single :) We can change those heâs to sheâs just for today? 4th over: Australia 26-2 ( Perry 8, Lanning 1) Perry knows how to turn disappointment into crushing disappointment in a single stroke, a drive through midwicket off Kate Cross sighs prettily over the rope the ball after the stumping review. Perryâs foot seems to rest almost exactly on the white line at the crucial moment. A fine bit of work by Warwickshireâs Amy Jones, but Perry survives by a big toe. England look confident as the umpires consider the review... We look at the replay from the side and the back... 3rd over: Australia 17-2 ( Perry 0, Lanning 0) Two big banana inswingers from Anya Shrubsole, but Healy drives the second straight down the ground for four. Then a wide. And another one. Yikes, Healy looking ominous. But Shrubsole has always possessed the ability to conjure important wickets from nothing. And does it again! The danger woman goes! A vague drive to Danni Wyatt at backward point is well caught by Wyatt perching on her knees. 2nd over: Australia 11-1 (Healy 5, Lanning 0) Kate Cross on the money straight away. An energetic run up, long too. She bristles with the ball, and Bolton couldnât resist. Lanning carefully plays back her first two deliveries. A lovely tidy catch by Amy Jones as Bolton drives loosely at a wide one from Cross. 1st over: Australia 9-0 (Healy 4, Bolton 0) Not a great start with five wides from Shrubsole who is straying legside. Then Healy turns another wide one down past fine leg for four. can England restrict this dangerous Australian batting line up? Anya Shrubsole to bowl the first over. A reminder of the teams for those of you joining us late. Australia are unchanged, England are without Sarah Taylor, resting with an ankle niggle. Danni Wyatt replaces her. England: Tammy Beaumont, Amy Jones (w), Heather Knight (c), Natalie Sciver, Danielle Wyatt, Fran Wilson, Katherine Brunt, Anya Shrubsole, Sophie Ecclestone, Laura Marsh, Kate Cross. Australia: Nicole Bolton, Alyssa Healy (w), Meg Lanning (c), Ellyse Perry, Rachael Haynes, Beth Mooney, Ashleigh Gardner, Jess Jonassen, Delissa Kimmince, Georgia Wareham, Megan Schutt. Not sure if theyâre borrowing the World Cup win predictor for the womenâs ashes. Iâd guess: 60:40 Australia today? But Raf Nicholson has watched a lot of womenâs cricket and she points out that this would have been a winning total on Tuesday. Graham is keen to nail the Australian colours: âAustralians seem very exercised when their uniform is called yellow and green, insisting it is gold and green. If you ever see a piece of jewellery that colour, keep walking. I wonder what would be the best moniker for the colour? Canary, buttercup, primrose, maize, chunder yellow? If you want to call it gold you have to change it to something like the San Francisco 49ers or New Orleans Saints. â Chunder? Graham! I like buttercup. Banana is also good. Frank Keating once memorably called Wisden, âthe annual primrose doorstep.â Personally, I prefer yellow to gold and was slightly disappointed ten years ago when my husband told me he had bought a yellow car and then arrived in a gold one. I never admitted it though. Thanks Adam and hi everyone! Looks like a beautiful July afternoon at Grace Road, T-shirts and shadows, but England wonât be too pleased with that collapse of four for six at the end. Still, better than a collapse at the top of the order, which is what they conjured up for the first ODI. Tammy Beaumont was chuffed to bits when interviewed at the break. Honest too: âThe pitch was a little bit slow and we were a bit lucky with a few loose balls early on.â Beaumont brilliant but Australia too good. The most important component to a big ODI innings is partnerships and England never did that, their highest 65 between Beaumont and Knight for the second wicket. There was no collapse (until the end), rather, each time they had Austalia under pressure a bowling change was made by Lanning a wicket fell and the stand and Beaumont had to start again. The opener was outstanding in tallying her first Ashes ton and sixth in ODIs. She could not have done any more to keep the board ticking, getting to the mark at better than a run a ball. What a fantastic player she has been over the last three years. âIt is the best innings she has played for England,â says Charlotte Edwards. So, can Australia chase with more authority than they did on Tuesday? Can England hang on there with the ball and take advantage of bowling second on a used pitch? For that, stick around with Tanya Aldred to find out. Bye for now! Five for Kimmince! A superb shift by the seamer, claiming the third best figures for an Australian against England in ODIs. She leads Australia from the field with 5/26 from her 7.4 overs. In the process, sheâs torn this England innings apart. The fifth was Kate Cross, picked up first ball giving catching practice to point. Great job. Marsh tries to go long down the ground but doesnât get much of it, caught at long off by Gardner. Thatâs four for Kimmince, who is deservedly cashing in. 47th over: England 216-8 (Ecclestone 3, Marsh 2) It was this pair who put on a decent stand of 38 in the final handful of overs on Tuesday, Ecclestone the far more likely of the two to find or clear the boundary. But with Schutt on, they are going to have to get resourceful or back their eye. They do neither in this over, Ecclestone looking to clear the front leg but not getting the ball she needs. Excellent from the Australian opening bowler, who has been faultless today. Kimminceis getting just reward for an excellent afternoon at the bowling crease, Shrubsole her second wicket in the over when top edging high in the air, Mooney taking the straightforward chance at midwicket. 46th over: England 212-8 (Ecclestone 1, Marsh 0) Clever from Kimmince, sending it wide when Brunt dances before the ball is bowled. Healy did the rest, getting a good look to complete the classy stumping. 45th over: England 210-6 (Brunt 11, Shrubsole 11) Schutt has three left and they canât get her away either. Brunt advances to the final ball and makes solid enough contact to long-off but Mooney makes a brilliant diving one-handed stop in front of our press box position to ensure that they canât get four for it. When Beaumont was there, 270 was within reach. Now? Theyâll be very pleased with 250-odd. 44th over: England 204-6 (Brunt 9, Shrubsole 9) Kimmince again giving away very little: singles down the ground starting the over off the front foot, singles out to cover ending it off the back foot. In common is at no point did they get a chance to free the arms and attack the rope without a fair degree of risk. Lanning should just bowl out Kimmince here, I reckon. Especially given that Perry has been ropey. 43rd over: England 199-6 (Brunt 7, Shrubsole 6) Despite the fact that this pair can both hit the ball a long way, they are happy enough building in the smaller denominations here, the sweeper at cover the preference. It might be time for Brunt to take a few risks and bosh it about with Ecclestone able to replace her if it doesnât work out. 42nd over: England 195-6 (Brunt 4, Shrubsole 5) Kimmince is having a brilliant day, really showing her worth as a change bowler in this side. It wasnât for nothing that she held her nerve at number nine the other night, too. Clever cricketer. 41st over: England 193-6 (Brunt 3, Shrubsole 4) The start of happy hour, sent down by Wareham who has a bit of work today in this final ten. Sheâs bowled aggressively so far, which is to be commended. Brunt and Shrubsole, both still playing themselves in, are happy to take the singles on offer square of the wicket. 40th over: England 188-6 (Brunt 1, Shrubsole 1) The long-term opening bowling partners, Brunt and Shrubsole, are together now with bat in hand. The former has been just as important with her runs as her wickets over the last couple of years. She canât get Jonassen away here though, the successful over worth only three. Two in two overs! And it is the big one: Beaumont. She edges onto her stumps when going for the reverse sweep. The opener receives warm congratulations from the Australian players when walking off, marking the end of an outstanding hand. 39th over: England 185-5 (Beaumont 112, Brunt 1) Beaumont nearly run out! An excellent pressure over by Schutt, who has barely done a thing wrong across these two games so far. Back to the run out chance, Brunt tipped and ran to point, Beaumont en route before getting sent back. She was gone with a direct hit. Excellent cricket by Schutt and Healy: the bowler finding the edge, taken by the âkeeper up to the stumps. Perhaps a tad close for Wyatt to using the horizontal bat. 38th over: England 183-4 (Beaumont 111, Wyatt 25) Ping! Wyatt comes down the track at Jonassen who had her under control until the penultimate ball of this over, creating a half-volley and smashing it for four down the ground. Going again, I think sheâs steered that through the slips but it might have been off the edge, either way - three are added making eight from the over and 33 in the last five. 37th over: England 175-4 (Beaumont 110, Wyatt 18) Iâm advised that Beaumontâs century is the first by an England player since ODIs were incorporated into the Womenâs Ashes. Youâll see that in all of our copy later tonight, I suspect. Six from Schuttâs new over, her sixth of the innings, all in ones an twos. 36th over: England 169-4 (Beaumont 109, Wyatt 13) Gardner goes again and after the set pair set up the over with a couple of singles, Beaumont busts out the reverse sweep and nails it just wide of the fielder at backward point. A couple of further singles to finish makes another over worth eight. Theyâre on track for a very healthy total here, especially if Beaumont can last another half an hour or so. 35th over: England 161-4 (Beaumont 103, Wyatt 11) Charlotte Edwards on the TV notes that the job for Beaumont is to go BIG now, which she has once before against Pakistan in 2016 down at Taunton. Wyatt is making the running against Perry here though, hammering the second ball of her new spell past point for four. 34th over: England 154-4 (Beaumont 101, Wyatt 7) Beaumont is back on strike via a Wyatt single and the crowd go wild, confusing the pair. But now they get a chance to cheer, Beaumont tucking Gardner for the run she needs to bring up her first Ashes ton. âCome on!â roars the pocket-rocket opener. What a fine innings this has been, raising the hundred in 99 balls, striking 11 boundaries along the way. 33rd over: England 150-4 (Beaumont 99, Wyatt 5) Beaumont to 98 through midwicket and 99 in that diretion too. The 150 is raised when Wyatt gives her the strike back with one ball to go in the over... which she defends. DRINKS! Catch up with Victorâs latest following Englandâs win in the menâs World Cup yesterday, ensuring their progress to the semi-finals next week. 32nd over: England 146-4 (Beaumont 97, Wyatt 3) Gardner is on to replace Kimmince. Beaumont is sweeping, Wyatt pushing, Beaumont scooping, Wyatt paddling. The board keeps ticking, Englandâs opener three short of a ton. 31st over: England 141-4 (Beaumont 95, Wyatt 0) A wicket slows England down, the sucessful Jonassen over on track for a wicket maiden until Beaumont retains the strike with a push through cover. At Leeds, Afghanistan are making steady progress in pursuit of the Windiesâ 311-6. Straight down deep square legâs throat! Given how many sweeps these two have been playing, it was highly probable that the shot would get one of them. It was a full-blooded strike of the ball, but Gardner didnât need to move a muscle. 30th over: England 140-3 (Beaumont 94, Wilson 8) Beaumont gets two from a clip off Kimmince, running hard for the second. Later in the over she plays a gorgeous square drive steered between the two fielders patrolling the backward point region. Just about the shot of the day for mine, that. It advances the opener to 94. 29th over: England 132-3 (Beaumont 87, Wilson 7) When spin is on, these two will sweep at every avaialble opportunity. They have the paddle, the conventional, the lap, the reverse. In addition to a couple of drives down the ground, five are added from Jonassenâs first over back after Beaumont hit her out of the attack earlier. 28th over: England 127-3 (Beaumont 84, Wilson 5) Kimmince is an outstanding middle-overs bowler, the perfect combination of accuracy and pace variation. Itâs a great story behind her return to Australian colours after a long absence (which included working in a London pub for a time), and sheâs really making it count. 27th over: England 125-3 (Beaumont 83, Wilson 4) Four singles off Wareham, all taken via sweeps to fine leg. Wilson, in particular, is known as a prolific sweeper, taking the mantle from Lydia Greenway as the best in this England side when the World Cup winner retired a couple of summers ago. She was out sweeping on Tuesday, given leg before off her glove. Sure enough, that caused quite a stir: why isnât there DRS in this series? The technology is here, they saw it on the big screen. 26th over: England 121-3 (Beaumont 81, Wilson 2) Excellent from Kimmince, through another accurate over giving up just three. Sheâs very hard to hit from nagging line just on the off-stump, mixing up her speeds along the way. 25th over: England 118-3 (Beaumont 78, Wilson 2) Wilson has to dive to make her ground when Beaumont takes a quick single. The stumps werenât broken, otherwise she would have been in strife. But the near miss doesnât deter the opener, who moves through the 70s with a crisp conventional sweep to the rope. 24th over: England 109-3 (Beaumont 71, Wilson 0) A successful over, Lanning again rewarded with a wicket in the over where she made a change. Kimmince got the nod ahead of Nicola Carey for these ODIs and has looked the part so far. Meanwhile in menâs World Cup land, Plunkett wants the final on free TV. Iâm sure the players all think that, but it is interesting that he would actually say it. Sciver plays across the line and pays the price for missing the ball, struck on the back pad. That was good enough for the umpire, who didnât hesitate. 23rd over: England 106-2 (Beaumont 69, Sciver 14) Warhem begins her second spell from the Bennett/Curzon Rd/Broadcast end, her first three overs going for 0/16. Beaumont is dancing at her straight away, Sciver doing likewise when she gets on strike, winning a misfield out of Mooney at mid-off due to how hard she hits it. 22nd over: England 103-2 (Beaumont 67, Sciver 13) Sciver brings up the England 100, starting the new Gardner over with one behind square. Beaumont then paddle sweeps another single before Sciver picks out the midwicket sweeper. Theyâre risk-free runs, even when the reverse sweep is busted out later in the over. 21st over: England 99-2 (Beaumont 65, Sciver 11) Better from Perry, keeping Beaumont quiet early in the over. The opener plays a fine square drive through the gap that would have been four if not for an assured diving stop from Schutt. To finish, another dive is required - this time by Wareham - to again deny a boundary. 20th over: England 94-2 (Beaumont 61, Sciver 10) Thatâs Sciverâs jam, dancing down at Gardner from around the wicket and driving over mid-on for her first four. With four other singles around the sweepers, itâs another good over. 19th over: England 86-2 (Beaumont 59, Sciver 4) Good start for Beaumont, driving through the gap at cover for three. In response, Perry attacks the stumps but it ends up a full toss, the opener helping it along for four. The Australian attack-leader has not been at her best so far today. 18th over: England 77-2 (Beaumont 51, Sciver 3) Beaumont laps the first ball of Gardnerâs fresh over, bringing up her half-century from 44 deliveries, striking eight boundaries along the way. Only couple further singles come from it, though. Gardner was Australiaâs most frugal bowler here during the 2017 World Cup. 17th over: England 74-2 (Beaumont 49, Sciver 2) Perry returns to the attack, replacing Wareham. Beaumont plays her with respect, happy with a single to cover. Sciver, with one ball to deal with, needs to get low to a ball that doesnât get up but keeps it out safely. Beaumont is one away from raising her bat. 16th over: England 73-2 (Beaumont 48, Sciver 2) Sciver was superb on Tuesday. Sheâs off the mark first ball here today with a couple behind square. Of course, this is where she made her towering maiden ODI ton during the 2017 World Cup. Great change from Lanning to get Gardner on just as the previous pair were getting busy. Gardner strikes with her third ball! Brought in to replace Jonassen, Knight tried to take the off-spinner long and straight after dancing down the track but miscued the stroke, the ball flying high into the air, taken easily by Haynes at mid-off. 15th over: England 69-1 (Beaumont 46, Knight 17) You canât bowl full tosses at Tammy Beaumont, the opener hitting a four from the first ball of the over for the third time on the bounce. She really is flying now, striking at nearly 130. 14th over: England 62-1 (Beaumont 40, Knight 16) Beaumont is go! She begins the Jonassen over with a loft over mid-off for four, landing just inside the rope. Thatâs the way to go after a spinner, doing it early in the set. She goes again from the second ball, punching through cover and timing it so well that it runs away for four more. The 50-partnership is raised with it. Fine batting. Of course, after failing cheaply in the first ODI last home summer, she hit back to back tons against South Africa. Of course, now Iâve mentioned this sheâll get out straight away. 13th over: England 53-1 (Beaumont 31, Knight 16) Better from Wareham, who has found her length nice and early. Iâm enjoying how much air she is giving. Iâve no time for leggies who rush it through. Give me risk/reward, thanks very much. 12th over: England 49-1 (Beaumont 29, Knight 14) Beaumont is going again at Jonassen early in the over, this time on the cut first ball behind for her fifth boundary. A couple of further singles makes another healthy over. After the early wicket and slow start against Schutt, the England base is now building very nicely. 11th over: England 43-1 (Beaumont 24, Knight 13) The leggie Wareham is on for her first go and it takes Beaumont only only two balls to get resourceful, deflecting expertly through the vacant third man for four. Giving it plenty of air, the opener is playing watchfully before tucking one to keep the strike. 10th over: England 38-1 (Beaumont 19, Knight 13) Spin for the final over of the first power play, via left-armer Jess Jonassen. Singles are exchanged early in the over to the sweeper at cover. Given a bit more depth later in the set, Knight uses the crease and crunches behind point for four. Shot. Jonassen bounces back though, slipping a straight one past the captainâs inside edge. Theyâre up for leg before but the appeal is turned down. Of course, we have no DRS in this series. Grrrrr. 9th over: England 32-1 (Beaumont 18, Knight 8) Schutt oversteps first up, which is most unusual. Beaumont gets a fair of the free hit but not quite enough to reach the rope, a diving stop from Lanning denying the fourth. The skipper wouldnât be denied getting a boundary of her own later in the over though, Knight creaming an overpitched delivery through extra cover for four. Nice, positive batting. 8th over: England 23-1 (Beaumont 15, Knight 3) Beaumont takes one to third man early. Perry is up for leg before to Knight but it is quickly turned down. The captain picks out the fielders on the circle a couple of times but is unable to pick the gap. Speaking of the captain. âHeatherâs Prideâ took place last week, which was a competition where letters/videos were sent in by kids explaining why they should get a training session with England. By all reports, it was a lovely day. Here are the competition winners alongside Knight, Katherine Brunt and Anya Shrubsole. 7th over: England 22-1 (Beaumont 14, Knight 3) Beaumont takes a run off Schutt after a couple of maidens from her end, on the front foot to mid-on. Knight grabs a couple around the corner to get her moving in the right direction. These two have an even bigger job ahead of them than usual today with Sarah Taylor missing. 6th over: England 19-1 (Beaumont 13, Knight 1) Beaumont leaps onto a short and wide delivery, cutting her third boundary off Perry. Sheâs then down the other end via a steered single to third man. Good batting. Theyâre giving the home skipper nothing when sheâs on strike, Knight again playing out the remainder of the set. 5th over: England 14-1 (Beaumont 8, Knight 1) Schutt is bowling into a shoebox. It isnât always easy to get into that groove early as a swing bowler but it is exactly what the South Australian has done early on here. Knight is forced to make a good decision from each delivery, and does, playing out another maiden. 4th over: England 14-1 (Beaumont 8, Knight 1) Perry gives Beaumont a full toss on her pads and she makes no mistake putting it away through square leg to get off the mark. She makes it two boundaries in the over from the final delivery, crashing a half-volley through cover. Beaumontâs away. 3rd over: England 6-1 (Beaumont 0, Knight 1) Schutt is right on the money here, bouncing in after that familiar squat at the top of her mark, ala Rubel Hossain from the Bangladesh menâs team. A maiden it is, Knight in defence throughout. 2nd over: England 6-1 (Beaumont 0, Knight 1) Such a poor start for Jones, who has had a brilliant nine months or so. This is the series she has been longing to play in and dominate. Sheâll have to wait for Sunday now. Earlier in the over, she picked up a boundary off Perryâs first ball down to fine leg. With Taylor missing, the captain Heather Knight shuffles up to No3. She was out first ball to Perry on Tuesday, lbw, but is off the mark first up today, with a tuck behind square. Back to back soft dismissals for Jones, chipping a catch to midwicket. 1st over: England 1-0 (Jones 0, Beaumont 0) Tidy from Schutt to begin, line and length to Jones who is happy to get her eye in with the full face of the blade in defence. She is off the mark from the final delivery down to fine leg for the easiest of singles. Plug Schuttâs column again? I will. The discussion about how the Australian dressing room has changed from 2017 is really interesting. The players are on the field! Megan Schutt has the ball in her hand, running away from us at the the broadcast or Bennett end. Amy Jones will be facing the first ball, Tammy Beaumont opening the batting with her. PLAY! It is an ankle niggle. Official word from the England team: âSarah Taylor injured her ankle in the first ODI and hasnât recovered in time to play today.â Dave Lawrence opening up on the emails. âGreetings! Looking forward to another exciting Ashes ODI.â Good afternoon to you. Letâs hope for a high-scoring thriller. âRe: the multi-format series, would you not rather see a higher points weighting for the Test Match and lesser for the T20s? Or perhaps an extra test with one fewer of each of the limited overs formats?â My fix: ODIs 3, Test 5 (two each for a draw), T20s 2. Reduces the likelihood of an even scoreline and reflects the fact that winning an ODI is harder than a T20. England: Tammy Beaumont, Amy Jones (w), Heather Knight (c), Natalie Sciver, Danielle Wyatt, Fran Wilson, Katherine Brunt, Anya Shrubsole, Sophie Ecclestone, Laura Marsh, Kate Cross. Australia: Nicole Bolton, Alyssa Healy (w), Meg Lanning (c), Ellyse Perry, Rachael Haynes, Beth Mooney, Ashleigh Gardner, Jess Jonassen, Delissa Kimmince, Georgia Wareham, Megan Schutt. âIt is important that we move on quite quickly,â she says. âI asked for some fight in the last game after the bad start we had, which was brilliant. But not enough.â Sarah Taylor is out. She has a niggle. Danni Wyatt comes into the XI for her. Amy Jones will âkeep for England, as she does whenever Taylor misses out. Meg Lanning says that Australia would also have batted too âbut weâre comfortable chasing whatever they set us.â They are unchanged from Tuesday. In front of my OBO position, the England superstar âkeeper hasnât got the gloves on and doesnât appear to be warming up. Weâll find out whatâs going on there at the toss in a couple of minutes. Welcome to Leicester for the second Womenâs Ashes ODI! Itâs a glorious day here at Grace Road, where surely the successful captain at the toss will bat. It is a used pitch as well - the same strip that was played on when Australia got over the line by two wickets on Tuesday - so it will doubtless take to turn as the day wears on. The hosts were abysmal early with the bat in the series opener, slumping to 4/19 and eventually skittled for 177. All that stood between them and a double-digit tally was all-rounder Nat Sciver (64) and No10 Sophie Ecclestone (27 in 27 balls). But to their credit, they clung on. As Megan Schutt says in her column, which Iâll post below, the reason why Australia value wins over England so highly is that Heather Knightâs side do not give up. When numbers nine and ten came together in Australiaâs chase they still had 11 to get. Aside from Alyssa Healy (66), there was very little that was convincing about Australiaâs chase. It sets today up well. A reminder on how the multi-format points system before we get going: each of these three ODIs are worth two points, the standalone Test in Taunton later this month has four points on the line, the three T20s a further two to finish. It works quite nicely. As does the OBO when we talk throughout. Drop me a line! Hello!",0,0,2.234631299972534,-2.3659777641296387,0.00994580269310876

4821,699,2019-08-20 00:55:00,"my exchange email (bittrex) was hacked. lost everything. this happened last night, i am from pakistan so according to pakistan standard time. i will try to keep this short.

i want to make this post so maybe other people will not fall pray to this and maybe not make the same mistake as me. so let's begin.. last night i received a notification on my phone that my email (gmail) password was changed. i tried to change it back but i couldn't, i tried to recover it through my phone number and alternate email address but i couldn't since they were also changed to some russian phone number. after trying for 20 mins i finally reset the password and then from google's warning found out that the person (hacker) somehow obtained my bittrex exchange password from my email's password manager and i didn't even know that was a thing (screenshot attached below), apparently google keep all the saved password in plain text and he easily obtained them when he had access to my email and accessed my bittrex account. my bittrex was also 2fa protected but here comes the hard and stupid part. when i was setting up the 2fa i had stored the backup key in my google drive, the same email on which i had account in bittrex. so basically he checked my drive in the 20 mins that he had, copied the 2fa backup code from there and may have set it up on his phone (google authenticater) and successfully logged in and sold the coins i had and instantly withdrew the btc. i almost had 3600 usd there. after doing so much losses in altcoins this was all that i had left and he stole that from me. i know this is nothing for most of you but this was my livelihood and i almost had a panic attack when i checked that my bittrex balance was zero.

i know i will never able to get it back and i also know that this happened partly because of my stupidity by keeping coins on exchange and also keeping my 2fa on the same email address google drive... well .

but here are the questions i have:

1. how could he have know my email address and know that it was my exchange email? i have never shared with anyone, except a few friends who are not tech savvy and can never do this and i am pretty sure they do not even remember my email.
2. how can he changed my email password? how can he or they hack my account so easily?
3. how is this possible that somebody from a different continent opened my gmail and changed password and all details and google didn't stop it? normally they ask for identity confirmation if i even open from a different browser or city or some shit like that.

last night everything was not in my favor. this was extremely hard on and i lost everything that i have since i am working an intern here in one place and they do not pay much so this was basically my source of income which he robbed me off. i can't even share this with anyone.  i am just in room with a lot of pain.

last but not the least, i also made this post hoping that maybe someone will donate something to me. i am in a lot of stress right now and anything will help me. i am just in a lot of pain.  if you can donate anything,  i will appreciate it. if you want additional information, please ask me. here is my bitcoin (btc) address

&amp;#x200b;

i don't uderstand how can one hacker become a millionaire stealing millions $ worth of cryptocoins from crypto exchanges like cryptopia given that:

1) he has to sell them in a public exchange

2) by definition/core the wallets of the hacker are public

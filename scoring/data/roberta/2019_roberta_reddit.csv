699,2019-08-20 00:55:00,0,"my exchange email (bittrex) was hacked. lost everything. this happened last night, i am from pakistan so according to pakistan standard time. i will try to keep this short.

i want to make this post so maybe other people will not fall pray to this and maybe not make the same mistake as me. so let's begin.. last night i received a notification on my phone that my email (gmail) password was changed. i tried to change it back but i couldn't, i tried to recover it through my phone number and alternate email address but i couldn't since they were also changed to some russian phone number. after trying for 20 mins i finally reset the password and then from google's warning found out that the person (hacker) somehow obtained my bittrex exchange password from my email's password manager and i didn't even know that was a thing (screenshot attached below), apparently google keep all the saved password in plain text and he easily obtained them when he had access to my email and accessed my bittrex account. my bittrex was also 2fa protected but here comes the hard and stupid part. when i was setting up the 2fa i had stored the backup key in my google drive, the same email on which i had account in bittrex. so basically he checked my drive in the 20 mins that he had, copied the 2fa backup code from there and may have set it up on his phone (google authenticater) and successfully logged in and sold the coins i had and instantly withdrew the btc. i almost had 3600 usd there. after doing so much losses in altcoins this was all that i had left and he stole that from me. i know this is nothing for most of you but this was my livelihood and i almost had a panic attack when i checked that my bittrex balance was zero.

i know i will never able to get it back and i also know that this happened partly because of my stupidity by keeping coins on exchange and also keeping my 2fa on the same email address google drive... well .

but here are the questions i have:

1. how could he have know my email address and know that it was my exchange email? i have never shared with anyone, except a few friends who are not tech savvy and can never do this and i am pretty sure they do not even remember my email.
2. how can he changed my email password? how can he or they hack my account so easily?
3. how is this possible that somebody from a different continent opened my gmail and changed password and all details and google didn't stop it? normally they ask for identity confirmation if i even open from a different browser or city or some shit like that.

last night everything was not in my favor. this was extremely hard on and i lost everything that i have since i am working an intern here in one place and they do not pay much so this was basically my source of income which he robbed me off. i can't even share this with anyone.  i am just in room with a lot of pain.

last but not the least, i also made this post hoping that maybe someone will donate something to me. i am in a lot of stress right now and anything will help me. i am just in a lot of pain.  if you can donate anything,  i will appreciate it. if you want additional information, please ask me. here is my bitcoin (btc) address

the only exploits that exist require physical access to the hw and don't work if your seed phrase is encrypted with a pass phrase.

i have seen several instances like this: [https://www.coindesk.com/bittrex-target-of-latest-1-million-crypto-sim-hack-lawsuit](https://www.coindesk.com/bittrex-target-of-latest-1-million-crypto-sim-hack-lawsuit)

if a 2nd password was require for withdrawal, even if someone hacked into an account, they would not be able to withdraw coins.

a variant of this idea, would be to require the use of a 2nd password anytime a customer logs in from a new ip address. this would be much safer than doing a confirmation email.",Bittrex,0,2.1066153049468994,-2.1493875980377197,0.013980634084374782

&amp;#x200b;

i don't uderstand how can one hacker become a millionaire stealing millions $ worth of cryptocoins from crypto exchanges like cryptopia given that:

1) he has to sell them in a public exchange

2) by definition/core the wallets of the hacker are public 

&amp;#x200b;

how would one become a millionaire if his wallets are blacklisted and if they are not why so? what is the point of doing an online stealing of crypto currencies in the millions $ if you cannot sell them? if you can sell them why make the coins vulnerable to such attacks if everything can easily be avoided with blacklists...?!

finally why would cryptopia be stupid enough to put millions of $ under singular wallets? why wouldn't they limit the amount of transactions which can be made in 24 hours? why were they sleeping after 14 of january given that reports claim the stealing continued till 17 of january which is really astonishing. this is pretty much criminal neglience and they should be charged for it! just filling bankruptcy shouldn't be making you innocent with such absurd management...",Cryptopia,0,2.1497039794921875,-2.246441125869751,0.012174708741817725

by all means you can get away with it, but it's silly to say ""you'd have to be dumb to get caught"".  you'd have to be very smart to successfully pull it off.  at a minimum, all of your procedures and policies will be audited for wrongdoing, and *someone* will be held liable for those.  they will absolutely find out *how* the funds got stolen.  and once that person gets thrown under the bus and is facing their own charges, they very well might sing.  

people are unpredictable.  some developer was promised a handsome jackpot for letting the breach happen, but soon finds themselves at the shit end of an investigation &amp; blamed by the company they are covering for.  they find themselves &amp; their family &amp; friends under severe scrutiny while they sort out very scary consequences.  they have no way of secretly cashing in on their stolen funds, all accounts are monitored for suspicious payments.

that's when they snitch.

it would be very difficult for any insider to reclaim their $50 million that was stolen.  you'd have to be pretty genius to pull it off.. ",Upbit,0,1.9327472448349,-1.8914036750793457,0.021370306281508752

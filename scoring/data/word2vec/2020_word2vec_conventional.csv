Police and firefighters were called to the scene after a report about a bee sting on a boulevard in Pasadena on Wednesday evening. Two firefighters, two police officers and one civilian ended up at hospital after being stung. ‚ÄúSomething set them off, some activity, noise, vibration ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs hard to tell what,‚Äù Dave Williams of the Los Angeles County Beekeepers Association told local television station KTLA. ‚ÄúWe have firefighters who have been working here for many, many years, and they said this is by far the most bees they‚Äôve seen at one location,‚Äù a Pasadena fire department spokeswoman, Lisa Derderian, told the Los Angeles Times. Africanized bees are descended from a cross-breed between African and European bees that was introduced in South America in the 1950s but which escaped and proliferated, breeding with local species. Due to their habit of aggressively defending their nests, the insects have acquired an familiar nickname: killer bees. In Pasadena, police and firefighters first tried to calm the bees with smoke, then used fire extinguishing foam to kill the bees after they failed to calm down. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt like to kill bees, we‚Äôre beekeepers,‚Äù Williams told KTLA. ‚ÄúBut in a situation like this, where the public safety is of concern, we have to take care of the public.‚Äù",0,0.21973825977229103

But sources suggest that, contrary to headlines about the shoes being banned, the issue remains under debate. As things stand, the group‚Äôs emphasis appears more on putting limits to the future incarnations of the technology, which was first introduced in 2016, rather than restricting the Vaporfly shoes completely. One option under consideration is to put limits on the size of the foam midsoles in all shoes, something that would make the next‚Äëgeneration AlphaFly shoes worn by Eliud Kipchoge in his sub-two‚Äëhour marathon run in Vienna illegal. Kipchoge insists that focusing on his Nike shoes is wrong. ‚ÄúThey are fair,‚Äù he told the Telegraph. ‚ÄúI trained hard. Technology is growing and we can‚Äôt deny it ‚Äì we must go with technology.‚Äù There have also been suggestions that similar shoe technology was used to power Laura Muir‚Äôs spikes on the track last year.

The punters who‚Äôll gather to hear him play are residents at an aged care home on Sydney‚Äôs north shore. And depending which way you look at it, either Helwend or his audience members are behind glass. This is window therapy ‚Äì a way of engaging elderly people with the arts (and a good singalong) while physical distancing restrictions are in place. Musician and actor Benhur Helwend adds colour to the windows ‚ÄúUsually I start by drawing a big gigantic love heart on the window, and then I write ‚ÄòI miss you‚Äô,‚Äù Helwend says, outlining a new performance kit that includes liquid chalk markers as well as huge amounts of window cleaner. ‚ÄúThe residents are in their common room and they are facing the window, and I‚Äôm on the other side with a microphone and a little PA. It‚Äôs very difficult for me to hear them, so a lot of it is very visual. I‚Äôll draw the songs a bit like Pictionary, and they have to guess the tune we are about to sing.‚Äù Helwend is primarily a musician and actor (you might have seen him in ABC‚Äôs Les Norton last year), and laughs while describing his illustration powers as ‚Äúreally bad‚Äù. Still, he is slowly developing the ability to write backwards, and has started incorporating what he calls ‚ÄúMr Squiggle‚Äù elements into the shows at Whiddon Hornsby: residents place their hands on the window, then he traces around and creates drawings from their handprints. But Helwend‚Äôs main point of connection is through song, and after three years of closeup visits to this facility ‚Äì plus more than a decade at other aged care homes ‚Äì he knows which tunes will get feet tapping, even at a distance. The Whiddon Hornsby crowd are big fans of Doris Day tunes, Helwend says. Alongside What a Wonderful World, You Are My Sunshine, and Aussie standards such as Waltzing Matilda and the Happy Little Vegemites jingle. The window therapy shows were, Helwend admits, ‚Äúa bit shaky at first‚Äù. Uncertain of even leaving the house at the beginning of lockdown, he was also ‚Äúterrified of potentially exposing a resident‚Äù. Even so, those early performances were ‚Äúincredibly emotional‚Äù, he says. ‚ÄúThe initial reaction was just joy. I would sing a song and, despite me not hearing their reactions, I could see them singing along or tapping their feet. They were connecting with the music ‚Ä¶ even just a finger tap or a toe tap is enough.‚Äù Staff, too, notice the difference. ‚ÄúOur residents love their creative engagement sessions with Benhur, and are thrilled that these can still take place during visitor restrictions ‚Äì albeit through the window,‚Äù says the facility‚Äôs director of care services, Sally Martin. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so important, particularly at this time, to keep their spirits up and keep them engaged through play and fun.‚Äù Now with six weeks of performances under his belt, Helwend says he finds great satisfaction in maintaining connections with his ‚Äúelders‚Äù through a sheet of glass ‚Äì and he‚Äôs not alone. Benhur Helwend beckons one of the residents to come to the window. Coronavirus restrictions have prompted the formation of the Outside In Collective (AKA ‚ÄúBoredom Force‚Äù), a loose coalition of creatives who work in aged care facilities, engaging residents with the arts. Founder Maurie Voisey-Barlin came up with the idea of window therapy and was quick to spread it around. Together, the collective is providing window therapy at 10 sites across New South Wales. For Helwend, the weekly bookings are meaningful work. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm contributing to the happiness of people in the last stage of their lives,‚Äù he says. And why is window therapy so important? The best answer is in the lyrics of one of his favourite songs, Hello in There by John Prine, Helwend says. ‚ÄúOld people just grow lonesome,‚Äù he sings. ‚ÄúWaiting for someone to say, ‚ÄòHello in there, hello‚Äô.‚Äù",0,0.05627835904851635

161,2020-04-22 20:30:06,Liquid,"Weatherwatch: what is the dew point?The dew point is the temperature at which a certain area of air must be cooled to for dew to form. It is also commonly interpreted as a measure of the air‚Äôs moisture content. As air cools, the amount of the gaseous form of water it is capable of holding decreases, and as such, cooling will eventually result in it reaching saturation point, beyond which condensation into liquid water droplets occurs. This is the main process behind cloud formation in the atmosphere. Of course, dew can also form on surfaces on earth. When the surface (for example grass or cars) cools below the dew point temperature of the air adjacent, condensation droplets from the air deposit onto that surface. If surface temperatures fall below 0C and below the dew point temperature, instead of water vapour gas condensing to water droplets, it transitions directly to crystals of ice, in the form of frost. While frost formation in winter months is rather common, surface temperatures in autumn or in spring are less likely to fall down to the air‚Äôs dew point, aided by the shorter overnight cooling periods. Hence, dew and frost do not form as readily, especially on objects which can have larger stores of heat in them, such as roads.",0,0.07263495237051933

Place the biscuits in a sandwich bag and use a rolling pin to crush them into fine crumbs. Place in a bowl and pour over the melted butter/coconut oil. Stir together until the crumbs look evenly coated, and then press into the base of a 9in round ovenproof dish. Alternatively, you can make the vegan and gluten-free version. Place the dates in a food processor and blitz until they are sticky and form a ball. Add the blanched almonds, a pinch of salt and coconut oil, and blitz again until combined. Press this mixture into your dish. For the cheesecake, use a food processor to blend the tofu until smooth (or use cream cheese). Remove a couple of tablespoons and whisk this together with the cornflour in a separate bowl. Add back to the main mixture, along with the caster sugar, rosewater (optional), melted coconut oil and grated lemon rind. Mix together again until smooth and combined. Pour over the biscuit base, and then bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until slightly coloured at the edges and there is still a slight wobble in the centre. Cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge to finish cooling. Meanwhile, make the edible decorations. Cut simple petal shapes from the wafer paper, then use a paintbrush to very lightly wet these. Paint using food dye mixed with a little water. When the wafer paper is wet, you will be able to shape it so that it looks more realistic. For the stem make a long stem shape painted brown.

164,2020-04-19 11:00:36,Melon,"The best wines to drink during lockdownStrange the things you learn at a time when a trip to the bins is what passes for a night on the tiles. Stuck inside with too much time on my hands, I‚Äôve discovered that nettles make better soup than damply greasy chips; that rice ground up in the coffee grinder is a perfectly adequate replacement for flour; and that the dregs of an old jar of sumac bring just the right edge of earthy bitterness and scarlet tint to a homemade, non-alcoholic Campari-esque cordial (made with the juice and zest of two oranges boiled down with a cup apiece of sugar and water). More seriously, I‚Äôve realised that times of anxious confinement lend themselves only to very moderate wine consumption ‚Äì no more than a glass a day ‚Äì and that each daily glass should provide the maximum comfort for the money. By comfort, I mean flavours and textures that are soothing in themselves, whether that‚Äôs because they trigger distracting happy memories of a place or time, or because there‚Äôs something intrinsically consoling in the way they‚Äôre put together. Everyone will have their own idea of a comfort wine, but over the past few weeks I‚Äôve found myself increasingly drawn to red and white styles that share certain sensual qualities: mouthfilling richness, directness of flavour, and a suave smoothness. In whites, that means ripe chardonnay (wines taking their cue from M√¢con in southern Burgundy or the warmer spots of California rather than the leanly citrussy style perfected in northerly Chablis); the fruit of Alsace pinot gris and blanc and its New World imitators, from New Zealand to Oregon and Chile; the unashamedly fat palate and alluring apricot-and-honeysuckle scents of wines made from the viognier variety; the orchard-in-autumn-scented South African chenin-blanc-based blend. In reds, the blueprint is the sun-baked blend of grenache, syrah and mourvedre perfected in the southern Rh√¥ne valley, but available in different shades and more or less brambly-fruited, peppery or garrigue herby variations across the Mediterranean, in California, South Africa and the great old vineyards of Barossa and the Eden Valley in Australia. But I‚Äôve found cosiness, too, in the chocolatey notes and soothing velvety-texture of Argentinian malbec, the vivid blackcurrant pastille softness of Chilean cabernet sauvignon, and the savoury mellowness of rioja ‚Äì simple pleasures for complicated times. Cave de Hunawihr Kuhlmann-Platz Pinot Blanc Alsace, France 2017 (¬£9.99, as part of mix six, Majestic) Just a touch of sugar adds to the feeling of ripe juicy greengage, melon and peach in this gently mouthfilling pinot blanc, with a ripple of racy acidity and white flowers bringing a spring-like feel. Co-op Irresistible Viognier IGP Pays d‚ÄôOc, France 2018 (¬£8, The Co-op) A textbook example of viognier from the versatile winemaker Jean-Claude Mas, with all the variety‚Äôs alluring apricot and honeysuckle aromas and a ripe, full, but not at all overbearing palate.

165,2020-04-21 11:45:02,Parity,"Your starter for 10: where are all the women on University Challenge?Judging by the gender balance, you could be forgiven for thinking that this year‚Äôs University Challenge grand final had taken place sometime in the 1970s. There wasn‚Äôt a single woman on screen for the entire 30 minutes. This is not to detract from the achievement of the winners. The triumph of Imperial college in this week‚Äôs final was pleasing ‚Äì it‚Äôs always pleasing to see an Oxbridge college brought down a peg or two ‚Äì and the breadth of knowledge displayed was incredibly impressive. But we cannot be expected to believe that there wasn‚Äôt a single female student at Imperial or Corpus Christi who could have added to those teams. I didn‚Äôt do badly playing along at home, answering a number of questions correctly where the contestants on screen did not, and I am very far from being exceptional. Perhaps had a woman been present she would have known the names of the other female winners of the Prix Goncourt ‚Äì Le√Øla Slimani and Marguerite Duras ‚Äì as well as that of Simone de Beauvoir. The gender balance on University Challenge is a longstanding issue that has been highlighted in the past by Mary Beard and Gloria De Piero, among others (the 2014 series was a staggering 84% male, while this year, of 28 teams, only five were equally gender-balanced). It is one which, to the show‚Äôs credit, it has tried to address. In 2018 it agreed to more ‚Äúgender-neutral‚Äù questions . Was this behind this final‚Äôs round on fashion designers, I wonder? Perhaps the question writers were inspired by the scene in which Bridget Jones, having been baffled by the questions at a Law Society dinner, some of which are in Latin, succeeds in identifying the designers of Princess Diana‚Äôs wedding dress. That pledge was two years ago, and these days the questions don‚Äôt seem to be the problem so much as the recruitment process, which is handled by the universities themselves, and which was brilliantly satirised in the form of Benedict Cumberbatch‚Äôs anal retentive ‚Äúfloating renaissance man‚Äù team captain in the film adaptation of Starter for 10. I suspect the problem with this is twofold: students are almost certainly not working hard enough to recruit women and make their teams inclusive, but also women themselves may not be as keen to appear on television, for a number of reasons. Earlier this year, former contestant Lucy Clarke wrote in the Observer of the misogynistic abuse she received on social media after appearing on the show. Can anyone really blame women for wanting to swerve comments from dirty old men speculating as to whether a young student many years his junior ‚Äúsucks like a Dyson‚Äù? I know experienced female journalists who avoid appearing on TV for the same reason. To expect women barely out of their teens to put up with this is a big ask. As Clarke pointed out, quizzing has long been accepted as male. ‚ÄúThe teams are selected by the students themselves and I think most of them would jump at the chance to have a girl on the team, but not many apply,‚Äù former contestant Sophie, who was part of the 2010 St Andrews team, tells me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why that is. If it‚Äôs a confidence thing, then that would be a shame. But I think that the subset of people who love memorising random facts, remembering them under time pressure, and, honestly, showing off about their general knowledge, tends to skew fairly male and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with that.‚Äù There‚Äôs that saying, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt be what you can‚Äôt see,‚Äù and I do wonder if University Challenge‚Äôs reputation as a male-dominated show means that many women can‚Äôt envisage themselves taking part. ‚ÄúIt never occurred to me that I‚Äôd get into the team,‚Äù says Sophie. ‚ÄúWhen an email went round mentioning the tryouts, I thought my boyfriend would be good at it. So I said I‚Äôd go to the tryouts if he did. And then I got on the team and he didn‚Äôt.‚Äù For as long as women continue to face abuse, underestimate themselves or be under the impression that quiz shows are not for them, University Challenge will continue to be male dominated, which is why, for the next series, it should give gender-balanced quotas a try.

Not for the first time Pope‚Äôs tweets catapulted him into the centre of a storm but six months on and before facing Manchester City in the FA Cup third round, the striker unapologetically stands by his words. ‚ÄúOne hundred per cent,‚Äù Pope says. ‚ÄúIt was tongue-in-cheek, saying [I‚Äôd score] 40 goals a season. But every single footballer has got their strengths and weaknesses. John Stones is a world-class centre-half and his technical ability is second to none but what I do before a game is I look at the two centre-halves and go ‚ÄòRight, who is the weaker of the two?‚Äô And I try to play on the weaker one. It is old-fashioned percentage play. If I play on him, I‚Äôll win 80% of my headers. ‚ÄúIf I had a choice of [playing against] John Stones or Virgil van Dijk, I‚Äôd go and sit on John Stones. He is physically not the strongest centre-half. He is a ball-playing centre-half. That is not a criticism of him but as a target man, if you are Andy Carroll or Peter Crouch, they would all do the same thing and try and bully him and rough him up. I‚Äôd stand by that. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it was overly critical. I just pointed out the physical side of his game wasn‚Äôt one of his strengths and that it is something I can prey on. As a target man, if you look at a small footballing centre-half, you are licking your lips thinking: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to rough him up and cause some damage.‚Äô That is when the team have to play to your strengths; there is no point trying to play against Man City trying to out-pass them because you‚Äôd get mullered.‚Äù Pope relishes the blood and thunder of battle and lists Harry Maguire, Aden Flint and Sami Hyypia, whom he faced when Crewe took on Liverpool in 2008 before coming away with Daniel Agger‚Äôs shirt as a memento, as some of his toughest opponents over the years. But Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side, Pope says, will prove a different proposition. ‚ÄúThis Man City team are probably something else,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNot one person on the planet is going to fancy us to get anything from the game ‚Äì not even us ‚Äì and sometimes when there is no pressure on the game, you can have a little feelgood factor about yourselves. You just go out there and try to do the best you can and try not to be embarrassed. And sometimes strange things can happen.‚Äù Unsurprisingly Pope does not take himself too seriously. When his Stones comments were dug up at the start of December, Pope referred to himself as a ‚Äúcarthorse‚Äù. The striker is a self-deprecating character and throughout this almost hour-long conversation his searing honesty is refreshing and endearing but he knows that his tongue ‚Äì his tweets, to be precise ‚Äì have landed him in hot water. Last month the 34-year-old served a one-match ban for abusing Crewe fans after being found in breach of the Football Association‚Äôs Rule E3, and has had to stump up thousands of pounds in fines after three separate charges, two from the FA and one from the League Two club. ‚ÄúMy wife is at the end of her tether with it. Everybody keeps telling me you need to come off [social media] but I love interacting with people. If I reported everybody who abused me, there would be nobody left on Twitter.‚Äù Pope was brought up a mile from Vale Park and a boyhood supporter, going back to the days when his grandfather, Joe, would push him and his brother under the turnstile. These days Pope lives a 10-minute walk from the stadium and is Vale‚Äôs longest-serving player. After scoring almost 150 goals across 500 league career appearances he is comfortable in his own skin. ‚ÄúI know what I am, I‚Äôm the slowest footballer in the world,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come last in any running race but I also know what my strengths are and, if you play to my strengths, I know I am a handful for anybody. When opposition managers and centre-halves are coming off after games shaking your hand and saying: ‚ÄòFlipping hell, what a battle or you‚Äôve battered us,‚Äô you know you have still been effective. I‚Äôm just an old-fashioned centre-forward. I don‚Äôt try to do anything I can‚Äôt do. I‚Äôm not going to start trying to take people on. I‚Äôll try and get hold of the ball, win my headers and bring people into play.‚Äù At 19 Pope ditched a nine-to-five job glazing windows and took a pay cut to sign for Crewe on ¬£200-a-week, seven years on from them releasing him as a boy and after four years on the non-league circuit with Biddulph Victoria and Sneyd FC, a Sunday League team his father, Rob, managed for years. ‚ÄúWhen you are 15 and scoring goals, people are kicking lumps out of you.‚Äù Few of City‚Äôs superstars will have had such a similar grounding. ‚ÄúNo, but they have all got big houses so. if any of them ever need any windows doing, then maybe I‚Äôll give them a call,‚Äù Pope says, breaking into laughter. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd go up for a header and land on the floor and they‚Äôd stamp on you while you‚Äôre down. My old man would always say, ‚ÄòGet up, get yourself up.‚Äô You don‚Äôt want to give the opposition any thought that you might be weak or that they might be bullying you or have got the better of you. You just get back up and go again.‚Äù That will be Pope‚Äôs mantra against City, along with sticking to his guns. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to be robotic. That‚Äôs what they try to do now, they try to silence people. Anthony Joshua, when he‚Äôs doing media, I think a lot of it is stage-managed and scripted to keep fans on side. With me, I‚Äôll just say what I think. If we‚Äôve had a 5-0 drubbing the media are always asking for me after because I‚Äôll be honest and not beat round the bush. I‚Äôm not going to be silenced. There are a lot worse people on the planet than Tom Pope.‚Äù",0,0.05124866848638498

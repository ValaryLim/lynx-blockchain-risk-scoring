there's no regulation in defi though so the collateral chain systematic risk, it's there.

i mean it's all supposed to be transparent and to a certain extent it is but i saw some developments where you can put collateral on one platform but then also use that as a kind of collateral on another platform at the same time (or at least the ' over collateral ' part ).

let's say for f2pool did, using a timestamp 10 minutes in the future, solve  629,999 but then held onto the block (i.e., not broadcast it).  but then for whatever reason they did share the block privately with antpool who then also was working on 630,000 (while everyone else was still trying to solve 629,999.

then if f2pool gets 630,000 they broadcast both (and likely would have had a message embedded in 630,000 as well).  if antpool gets 630,000, they broadcast f2pool's 629,999 as well as their 630,000.    if either f2pool or antminer detects that some other pool solves 629,999, then both blast out f2pool's 629,999 so as to not have too much hashrate mining to extend the other pool's block.

withholding the block does increase the risk that f2pool's 629,999 would lose permanently, and not be in the ""greatest work"" chain, so i don't see this as being actually what happened.

i do find it odd that nodes got both 629,999 and 630,000 in very rapid succession (a matter of seconds ... well under one minute)?   seriously, the most watched bitcoin block ever in its 11+ years took just 20 seconds to be mined?   possible.  but unlikely.   at the same time, i see ~zero gain from f2pool withholding 629,999, so who knows.",0,0.07876514845742508,bitcoin,cointastical

question #1  
prior to learning that it's best to associate an exchange account with a fresh email account with a unique handle, i created an account on coinbase with an existing email and purchased a small amount of crypto. would it be safe to transfer that cryptocurrency to a binance us account (which is linked to a new, unique email)?  


another way of asking is this: does a transfer between exchanges record a record of email addresses?  
i want to be as safe as possible, but to be honest, i don't quite understand the reason for these extra security measures.  


question #2:  
is a hardware wallet exchange-specific, or can one hardware wallet be used with multiple exchanges?  


question #3:  
i recently purchased some crypto on robinhood before understanding that the app doesn't allow users to transfer cryptocurrency to a hardware wallet. what's the best line of action here? should i just keep it in robinhood and forget about it, or should i sell in order to reduce risk of a data breach and loss of bitcoin?",0,0.07036160070145972,bitcoinbeginners,jeffreysbrother1

bittrex, as many of you know, is asking for more detailed info (ssn number, etc) by jan 14th 2020 or you can no longer use them.  i refuse to send them more personal info, so i will be withdrawing all my funds from there and no longer using them.

kucoin has a 2btc withdraw limit per day (unverified) which i'm totally fine with.  that's acceptable.

so, my question is what other exchanges can u.s. customers use that have no kyc and a ~2btc per day withdraw limit?  what other exchanges are similar to kucoin and legit?  huobi?  binanceus?  bitfinex?  kraken?    i am planning on using a vpn for added security.

you dont have a run a node to make a wallet.
making your own wallet is relatively easy, it will provide you with an id and key (password). you can write them down on a piece of paper as a qr code for ex.
then you can use that id and key in myetherwallet (which is actually a missleading name because its a wallet and a node).

those transactions are given to the blockchain via a node. so you can either use a public one or run your own (safer, but honestly hard to run one)

a wallet is just an id and a key, the coins are not literally in the wallet, the coins are registered by the network of computer in the blockchain, and the key is the only way to make them move to another ""wallet id"". 
to do that transaction, you ask the blockchain to make the operation. the thing that does that is a node.

cpp ethereum are open source projects that you can compile yourself to make a wallet and run a node.

http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum/

https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
-&gt;go ethereum is the reference implementation and the better choice.

some crypto exchanges are building similar reputations, like coinbase or binance. i’m still skeptical to keep crypto on exchange (lost some in exchange hacks) but it’s quickly becoming safer than it was. long term an exchange will make way more money than in an exit scam. employees or hardware failure risk is very real but there are processes and techniques that continue to evolve to minimize that risk.",0,0.10107792963902733,bitcoin,lodobol

2. we have multi signatures, 2-of-3 for example.
3. we have lightning channel open/close transactions

all of these different transaction types allow for chainanalysis to make certain assumptions. examples:

coinjoin -&gt; alice -&gt; bob -&gt; binance -&gt; account lockout
or
binance -&gt; alice -&gt; coinjoin -&gt; account lockout down the line

this new concept allows for hiding the transaction type, making the assumption much harder. example:

coinjoin -&gt; unknown transaction type -&gt; binance -&gt; uknown reaction

we can still spot the coinjoin, but the unknown transaction could be ln or anything really.

chainanalysis will have to respond in one of two ways:

bittrex, as many of you know, is asking for more detailed info (ssn number, etc) by jan 14th 2020 or you can no longer use them.  i refuse to send them more personal info, so i will be withdrawing all my funds from there and no longer using them.

kucoin has a 2btc withdraw limit per day (unverified) which i'm totally fine with.  that's acceptable.

so, my question is what other exchanges can u.s. customers use that have no kyc and a ~2btc per day withdraw limit?  what other exchanges are similar to kucoin and legit?  huobi?  binanceus?  bitfinex?  kraken?    i am planning on using a vpn for added security.

i am trying to deposit eur from my bank (which in the past 2 years worked just fine), my bank's called santander totta and my account is located in portugal.

when i insert all details it throws back a message ""the characteristics of the destination account do not allow this operation"".

i called the bank they say its an issue on your side (bitstamp) and that i should solve with you.

i can transfer normally to other fiat exchanges...

any clue on whats going on? i don't see any message about fiat deposits being on hold or suspended.

i am writing today to seek help and also to warn other people in the community. after more then 4 years in the crypto space i had the first terrible crypto experience and i am feeling left alone especially from bitstamp.

on the 8th of february between 4am and 4:45 am a new password was created, it was logged in into my account. all assets have been converted into btc and the btc amount sent to this btc address:   1mvqhbpvhhbsjgj9jypepzoqtqmnndqmap

i am using 2fa, the 2fa key is safely stored offline. my phone was next to me in my flat. i only life with my wife. obviously i trust her.

there is also no malware on my phone. it has been checked by a technician.

according to bitstamp i have authorized all transactions via mail or 2fa (forgotten password and password change)

a few key facts:

&amp;#x200b;

1. 2fa passwort was only stored physical
2. bitstmap pw only in my head
3. no emails received to authorize transactions
4. no malware on phone
5. phone next to beside table. most likely on flight mode since i always put it on flight mode during sleep. 

&amp;#x200b;

i have no explanation but an unsafe system at bitstamp. the ip who was taking the action was not mine but this:   ip: 91.64.214.247

please share your thoughts if you have an idea which could help.

police has been informed. 

bitstamp is no longer replying to my emails. in fact, it seems they have blocked my ip!

i think exchanges and crypto in general have moved on from when i first got involved in 2013
the days of the wild west are long behind us , with more stringent kyc procedures in place.

but it looks like i could just have the user add their public xrp address to their account (no security risk) and then when they send the xrp to to my address, i can see the address of the sender, and then use that address to know which account to give the items too. not sure if i even need xumm.

i have a question.

i have a bittrex account with around at this moment $50 worth of currency in it.

i decided to log into my account for the first time in two years only to find out that my account had been disabled. and i am unable to deposit or withdraw.

so i submitted a ticket.. and got word that i needed to verify my account, or they needed extra data, now i don't mind filling out my name and mail address etc. but they are also asking for a copy of passport or an id, and that is something i consider a very shady thing on the internet, even from legitimate companies.

so i'm now locked out of my account, and wondering if these $50 are worth making a copy of my id or my passport, there is a reason that in my country it is illegal for random companies to ask people for passport copies. so am i screwed here? or is there a way around it? 

&amp;#x200b;

i know this wasn't a thing two years ago, because i was able to use bittrex without them needing additional data back then.",0,0.08225732624617979,bittrex,sireastbound

bittrex, as many of you know, is asking for more detailed info (ssn number, etc) by jan 14th 2020 or you can no longer use them.  i refuse to send them more personal info, so i will be withdrawing all my funds from there and no longer using them.

kucoin has a 2btc withdraw limit per day (unverified) which i'm totally fine with.  that's acceptable.

so, my question is what other exchanges can u.s. customers use that have no kyc and a ~2btc per day withdraw limit?  what other exchanges are similar to kucoin and legit?  huobi?  binanceus?  bitfinex?  kraken?    i am planning on using a vpn for added security.

why it may be a smart option to not have an e-mail or other account that can be reset by text.

for instance, the blockfi situation may have been created by somebody doing a sim swap to gain access to the person's e-mail, and then they were able to gain access to their blockfi account.

if somebody were to call t-mobile to try and get the sim swap done, i think the account is protected by a pin number.

so no, it's highly unlikely it would be a public website, especially considering they most likely had access to the employees emails and 2fa.

i don't interpet it as them blaming the cell network vulnerability. in the same mail they clearly state they are beefing up their security, meaning that they recognize their responsibility in it. to me it's pretty clear from the mail that they both hold themselves and the cell provider accountable, which is justified.

hey i get that you're mad, i am too. but i think you're overthinking things and reading things too literal. their email to me came across as very carefuly worded to show both confidence and regret. you have to look at it from a business perspective too. if they handle this wrong it can be even worse for them than the data breach itself. the last thing customers need now is for blockfi to come across as groveling, afraid and desperate. and i think they've been transparant enough. it happened. they're increasing audits and penetration testing and beefing up their security. in the long run, breaches like this are actually a good thing for platforms, and we kind of got lucky that they couldn't gain access to the wider back-end. now that'll become even more difficult.",0,0.08632970326388648,blockfi,silverhoard

so basically the hacker had knowledge of blockfi's system that employees use and was able to access it using the employee's login.

i could be totally wrong, but it's my best guess.

this is why people do not like using text message for 2fa. nobody seems to be calling phone carriers out that they are the ones causing this security risk by allowing people's phone numbers to be ported by people who are not the account holders.

the confusion from customers is that blockfi offers authenticator 2fa to customers, so it is odd that they were having employees use text 2fa for their system accounts.

i suspect they have already opened a criminal investigation. the phone company may have audio records of the phone call where the hacker requested the number port. maybe somewhere along the chain of all these events there is something identifiable. maybe not. i think the hacker was trying to access funds, but failed. so just grabbed whatever data they could.",0,0.09378055151363483,blockfi,mr_chipmunkk

from my personal experience, having been involved in at least 4-5 data breaches that i know of,  the biggest thing to watch out for is phishing attempts. most people in the crypto space are already fully aware of this, but if you get an e-mail or phone call for instance from somebody claiming they are from blockfi saying to click some link or provide information do not do it.",0,0.08050052074726588,blockfi,mr_chipmunkk

i’d also like to mention i have dozens of other wallets and have never, in the time that i’ve been in crypto, had to use a seed phrase yet. but they’re all locked down, except this gem that was needed within a week because of a glitchy app. 

it should say “if you lose your phone or if our glitchy app force quits and logs you out for no reason”  would be helpful to have it connected to my coinbase account but that feature doesn’t seem to work either. and what’s with cb pro not showing my funds after a week? 

you guys are number 1 and should be representing us crypto a little better than a third rate ccp controlled shill. please make it mandatory to use a seed phrase until your app is stable or has another way to retrieve funds. but even meantime, i have a couple grand just chilling in borrowing and lending i can’t even see.

thank you u/coinbasesupport for helping me and for the quick response for my previous query.

i have now received an email stating my account has now been closed and also that my non essential data have been deleted.

however, i have a few questions i hope you could answer:

1. i requested that both my essential and non essential data be deleted. will my essential data/personal data be deleted as requested alongside non essential data?
2. why did i randomly received 2 emails on cancelled orders from 2017?
3. was the emails that was sent from from the associate general counsel a member of staff from coinbase?
4. what was the reason for me not being able to log in and unable to use the forgotten password option. was i hacked? or was i subject to a phishing attempt?

i keep finding different facts about this kind of wallets.
some say online wallets like coinbase and blockchain.com are more secure since they monitor the plataform. but still don't know if they got hack will everyone loose they bitcoins although we have their apps version install in our mobiles? do we have private keys or they sync with the online platform? or the two are independent on the operations?
and about personal wallets that dont have an online wallet, like bitcoin wallet or trust wallet, are they safer in my phone if i install them than the online wallets i mention above?

question #1  
prior to learning that it's best to associate an exchange account with a fresh email account with a unique handle, i created an account on coinbase with an existing email and purchased a small amount of crypto. would it be safe to transfer that cryptocurrency to a binance us account (which is linked to a new, unique email)?  


another way of asking is this: does a transfer between exchanges record a record of email addresses?  
i want to be as safe as possible, but to be honest, i don't quite understand the reason for these extra security measures.  


question #2:  
is a hardware wallet exchange-specific, or can one hardware wallet be used with multiple exchanges?  


question #3:  
i recently purchased some crypto on robinhood before understanding that the app doesn't allow users to transfer cryptocurrency to a hardware wallet. what's the best line of action here? should i just keep it in robinhood and forget about it, or should i sell in order to reduce risk of a data breach and loss of bitcoin?",0,0.07036160070145972,bitcoinbeginners,jeffreysbrother1

the thing is, in the inbox of the safe-mail.net email account, there are all of these emails with red subject lines saying ""your accounts were hacked!"" and ""your devices were hacked!"" many of these sorts of messages are in the junk folder but also inbox, and a few as recently as earlier this year.

 i am scared to actually even open any of those emails, but what really freaks me out is that the sender address is my exact safe-mail address.  i don't know if they are phishing emails that i shouldn't open or if they are actually indications that my accounts and this email address have truly been hacked, since the sender address is my exact email address.  

so the whole thing is freaking me out: i'm even worrying about having opened that email account on my phone browser, in terms of hacking or something -- i really don't want to contaminate any currently used devices or accounts or anything by opening a can of worms that may be compromised.  

i really don't know much about hacking, and the very idea freaks me out because i have no idea if i have taken the proper precautions or not.  any information relating to those accounts i only wrote down in a physical notebook, and the bitcoin wallet from that time still seems fine, and has 2 factor authentication (and i didn't use the safemail address for the wallet).  

but what i'm wondering is, should i actually be worried that my accounts using that email address were hacked, or that the email account was hacked? or are these just emails to get my attention to open them and i should just delete them all and everything is safe and i should just login to my coinbase etc accounts and then perhaps change the email address to one that i normally use and doesn't seem so sketchy like this safe-mail account.  

can anyone advise me on this?

first, physically securing your key phrase is impractical for most people, not to mention a technological regression from cryptographic security. home safes are expensive and there are stories of burglars ripping safes from floor boards while the owners were out. and if you can’t get home (like anyone who was locked out during quarantine) you’re out of luck. safety deposit boxes are also [out of the question](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/business/safe-deposit-box-theft.html).

second, you can try to store your key phrase digitally but in the end, you will have to either trust a cloud service provider or store it locally (which means having to physically protect the device it’s stored on). if you store your key phrase on a cloud service like google drive, dropbox, icloud, etc., you’ve put your trust in a company like any other and you may as well have put your bitcoin on coinbase.

lastly, you can try vitalik buterins method of breaking your key into 3 parts and trusting 2 parts each to 3 different trusted friends. personally, i don’t trust people that much. they could misplace it or conspire to steal it.

in the end, a large, reputable exchange with insurance seems like the right balance of security and convenience for now.

in the future, i certainly hope to see some decentralized version of identity verification and secure pass phrase retrieval. until then, what method are you using to keep your coin safe?",0,0.0683094827116883,bitcoin,admin_default

i joined a private website several months ago after i donated bitcoin from my btc wallet. however i logged in at a college campus and my account got disabled as a dublicate. (i guess someone else had an account) i tried to correct this however the moderators were having none of it. so i joined again. however i paid with the same coinbase account. the transactions were several months apart but i only used coinbase for these 2 transactions. aswell as adding the funds each time. my question is can both payments be linked?

if you are honest, not a troll, which is of course always a possibility, although remote, it is not rational to go with amaury.

huge mistake.

so, i uploaded my photo id and took a picture of myself with my webcam and got the message ""unable to verify your identity + photo coinbase""

i got a text from coinbase saying my password had been reset. when i went in to try to fix it, my email password had been changed as well. at this point i started freaking out and noticed i didn’t have cell service. i knew what was happening. 

i reset my phone and the service was back. i was able to get into my coinbase and nothing went missing. i immediately dumped everything into my ledger. so i got lucky there. i then got into my email and changed the password. i then noticed an email alert from earlier in the day letting me know my password had been changed from the uk (i’m from usa) and they used my phone number as the security method. so it seems they were able to get into my email using my phone number and that is when i knew it was a sim swap. 

i then went in and changed all my passwords (everything from my banks to my netflix) and added 2fa to anything that didn’t already have it. i also changed my security phone number on my email account to a google voice number. i am going to go back and do this on anything else that uses texts for 2fa. 

i then called my cell provider and they said my sim was in fact swapped earlier in the morning and swapped back about 15 minutes later (must have been when i reset my phone.) they said they would hand it over to the fraud department. i also tried to get a brand new sim card at the t-mobile store but they were unable to do it because of the fraud department locking my account until they get back to me. 

my question is this. have i done everything i need to do to protect myself from this happening again? i got lucky and it doesn’t seem like i lost anything so far, but i am worried that if they were able to get in once, they can get in again. i’ve been paranoid all day and my stress is trough the roof. changing passwords, adding 2fa, using google voice for text 2fa, and getting a new sim card; will these things protect me from the recent attack as well as prevent others?",0,0.09860017340926805,cryptocurrency,juancho393

there is a small group of people who make disney fan products, skirting copyright laws and the like just barely.

some of these have had disney shut down their payment options, and that's what happened to her.

she makes mickey ears in various styles, and she is extremely good at it, making the highest quality and cutest ears i've ever seen, by hand, with felt and needle.

then it happened. one day she announced she was having trouble with payment processors. guess she finally got popular enough that they took notice.

visa and mastercard cut her off, googlepay turned off her account, and applepay was next.

her last remaining option, strangely perhaps, became paypal. 

now this was a huge problem for a lot of her regular customers because she typically sells out within a minute of putting up her latest creations.

i was using gpay, and lost out on a sale due to paypal.

being friendly with her i got the inside scoop and urged her to add bitcoin cash to her site and sent her some of the introductory material from coinbase, so she now has two remaining payment options, paypal and cryptocurrency.

i then offered to help her test the system.

the more this kind of thing happens, the more we will be able to spread the message about permissionless payments. she didn't know anything about cryptocurrency, but was able to accept it with a day's worth of research.

seriously though, your statement “with just an address” is mute, it’s incredibly sophisticated beyond what you can imagine. look up palantir and what their capabilities are, the rabbit hole goes very deep and tools like it are being used for crypto. if anyone doesn’t think the us government isn’t spying on transactions and doesn’t track coins 10 hops before you get them, and 10 hops after at a minimum, automatically alerting on fraudulent or malicious activity, with automated integration to coinbase and other exchanges for user identification, then they’re living in a delusional world. let me be clear, unless you properly mix your coins outside of and post exchange withdrawal, you are being tracked with a with a digital fingerprint you’ve provided by simply sending crypto.

this is good for bitcoin though. it means they’re scared of it, and they dedicate massive resources to things they’re scared of. so it’s natural for this to happen. the us governments only true power now is that the dollar is the worlds reserve currency, so expect to be tracked and if you must do something illegal then properly mix your coins.",0,0.11182700910260675,bitcoin,cs001x

if this is the case, coinbase actually does not have the ability to initiate any transactions. ""non-custodial"" means the customer has full control of their assets, though the private key provided in the coinbase wallet app and/or the 24-word backup phrase. the only way to initiate transactions is to obtain this private key in some manner. so i would initially suspect that someone else possibly got ahold of the private key and used it to steal funds, similar to what u/axeyouaquestion is suggesting.

wright was supposed to deliver a list of ~16,400 blocks, since he'd previously claimed to have mined ~820,000 bitcoin. shadders's list was much bigger (27,973 blocks), so wright had to pare it down.

he appears to have first split the shadders list in two: the cw list and dk list. however, for some reason (most likely incompetence), the cw list was still too big, so wright needed to cut out more blocks.

his brilliant idea was to sort the list by txid and just cut out big chunks of blocks. the shadders list already included all the blocks' coinbase txids, so it would have been very simple. i imagine his reasoning was just that, ""since txids are random, cutting out chunks won't be a big deal"". however, that was a dumb idea, since it leaves a statistical anomaly.",0,0.05686472198142297,bitcoin,combustiblebitcoiner

so picture the scene, a miner adds a ‘block’ to the network. inside that block are all of the transactions they have ‘processed’ plus one extra, the coinbase transaction (also known as block subsidy). they effectively gave themselves 50 bitcoin every ten minutes. now, every 210,000 blocks, approx four years, it is written into the bitcoin protocol to divide that coinbase transaction by two. as a result, in 2012, miners were only able to award themselves 25 btc for mining a block. in 2016, it became 12.5. tomorrow it becomes 6.25! so you have joined bitcoin at quite an important moment.

you can store it on a paper wallet if you have a printer. as long as you have your private key nobody can steal it. unless they rob you.. but same goes for money or gold.

bitcoin.org has a video. i suggest you watch it and follow the instructions on the site for choosing a wallet. some soft wallets or browser based wallets are fairly safe. just dont go around advertising you have btc on your phone or laptop etc. you are your own bank!!",0,0.15084515728165143,bitcoinbeginners,atomica1

sorry this will get a bit technical-

in the past this was a side effect of one miner and their partners using  secretive asicboost, but since 2017 segwit being activated the incentives to use this instead of rolling overt asicboost where no empty blocks need to be occasionally be created this is no longer the reason. 

another reason is when the same mining pool immediately finds another block in seconds and doesn't want to risk losing the coinbase reward with the time of downloading the previous block and validating  

this is discussed here - 

https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/gb69pm/doubt_about_empty_blocks/

notice the followup from greg where he correctly points out that propagation advancements mean this isn't really a concern , so the very rare times an empty block is mined it might be more to do with miners being overly cautious or using older mining templates that do not take into account improvements 

the third possible reason is a malicious miner is trying to do a ddos attack, but this cannot be sustained because mining game theory will just punish the attacker and benefit other pools who include the txs the attacker is blocking",0,0.07499297212989821,bitcoinbeginners,bitusher

1.get yourself a hardware wallet. ledger nano s or trezor are the most recommended. i use ledger; very easy.

2. from the ledger, you'll get 24 word. these are the private key. write these down on the sheet of paper that you get from the ledger box. the sheet is numbered, so you sequentially will know when to write down which word.

3. keep the sheet of the number (the seed as it is called), in a safe space. presumably a safe with a lock. this hinders internet connection and isolates the 24-words. remember; the 24 words are the key to your bitcoin. you can have any ledger nano s and regain access of your bitcoin, but only if you have the 24 words. the 24 words is essentally where the bitcoin is; not the hardware wallet itself (ledger).

4. set it up via live live (use tutorials on youtube; it is easy). from the ledger program called live live, you can finally get the receiving address. copy it.

5. go into your coinbase account and paste it after pushing send bitcoin. make sure that the address is correct (usually it is enough to look at the last three and the first three letters). test out sending a small amount first, so that you are sure it came through.

6. it will take some time before the btc gets to your hardware wallet, but it will be there after 6 confirmations.

&gt; tls pinning would not have resolved the issue as the moonpay infrastructure was compromised and the malicious code served correctly.

certificate pinning would absolutely solve the issue.  the trinity wallet allows connection to and loading of content from moonpay servers.  with certificate pinning this would be blocked.  sure moonpay servers might have been compromised or you might have dns hijacking of those servers but if you have certificate pinning of a whitelist of hosts the wallet can connect to, a connection to and loading content from the moonpay cdn would never be allowed in the first place 

&gt; illicit versions of moonpay’s software development kit (sdk), which was being loaded automatically from moonpay’s servers (their content delivery network) when a user opened trinity. the code was loaded into the local trinity instance, and, after the user’s wallet was unlocked, decrypted the user’s seed and sent the seed and password to a server controlled by the attacker.

https://blog.iota.org/trinity-attack-incident-part-1-summary-and-next-steps-8c7ccc4d81e8

for example a security issue was raised in 2014 with coinbase android wallet because it didn't have certificate pinning.  this was when security was barely taken seriously and the amount of money was tiny.  6 years later, iota still didn't take security seriously.  after all this, does iota wallet now have certificate pinning implemented?  i haven't seen anything it their posts that it does.  iota is still blaming moonpay.  you trust this team with security?  this is remedial.

first, it is not wise to store bitcoin on anybody else's computer.  that means, don't use any web site to store your bitcoins.  

having said that, i'd like to point out that, you might have to store some on, say, coinbase, for a short time until you can transfer them to your own wallet running on your computer.  

the only thing that protects your bitcoins is keeping the private key secret.  your wallet probably gives you a 24 word pass phrase -- keep that secure.  if somebody gets a copy of your passphrase, they will steal your bitcoins.  unless somebody has your passphrase, they cannot steal them from you.  if you store your bitcoins at a web site, they have the pass phrase, and your bitcoin can be stolen.  

we like to repeat, ""not your keys (or pass phrase), not your bitcoins.""  andreas antonopoulos first said that (i believe.)  

bitcoin can be secure, but it's up to you to control the private keys (or pass phrase) and to protect it.

2624,2020-02-11 03:00:44,coinbase,"&gt; merkle trees

no header hashing in the merkle tree  
it's a binary data tree, with the leaves at the bottom  
the transaction hashes are the leaves  

*    hash every transaction  
*    arrange the transaction hashes in pairs  
*    hash each pair of hashes  
*    now you have a layer of nodes, one level above the leaves  
*    arrange these hashes in pairs, hash each pair of hashes  
*    each level has half the number of nodes of the level below  
*    repeat until you get a level which has only 2 hashes  
*    the merkle root hash is the hash of these 2 hashes  

in the mining context, the miner creates a block of transactions, including the coinbase transaction, imports the previous block's header hash into the header, calculates the merkle tree and merkle root hash, then ...  

*    iterate the nonce from 0 to 4294967295  
*    change the extranonce in the coinbase transaction  
*    recalculate the merkle root hash  
*    repeat  

note that if the miner is changing only the coinbase transaction, he only needs to recalculate the hashes at the left edge of the tree, not the entire tree

&gt; the extra nonce is almost like hacking the coinbase to find more possible txids which will give you the correct hash?

it's less deliberate than that. the miner's job is to find an 80-byte block header which has a hash which meets the target criterion. the 80 bytes consist of version, hashprevblock, hashmerkleroot, time, target and nonce. version, hashprevblock and target can not be varied by the miner. the time precision is one second, so it can be varied once per second. by elimination, if the nonce exhausts in less than one second, the merkle root hash must be changed. it could be changed by going to the mempool and finding a few extra transactions to add to the block. it's faster to change a few bits in an inconsequential part of the coinbase transaction

&gt; have any cryptocurrencies fixed this?

no idea if nonces have been increased in size or removed in other currencies",0,0.06617210671817846,bitcoinbeginners,igadjeed

i'm not sure if i grasped everything but got the gist. my understanding of merkle trees is a bit iffy. 

i think you start by taking the hash of the block header and the first txid, and then the hash of that and the second txid, and so on, then at the end try to find a nonce in the 32-bit space. if you don't you can add junk data to the coinbase then the hash of that changes, and you can try running through the 32-bit nonce space again. is that right?

so the extra nonce is almost like hacking the coinbase to find more possible txids which will give you the correct hash?

in general, it's better to keep bitcoin on a wallet which gives you access to the private key. this means, you and you alone have full control of the coins. an exchange like coinbase etc do **not** give you full control of the coins. you have to ask them when you want to move coins in or out, and they can refuse you service, or ask to provide personal details and so on, before they give you your coins.  

you should pick a wallet which lets you control your own coins, although this comes with some level of responsibility (backing up properly).  

some of the generally recommended wallets are:  

&gt; hardware wallet (highest security): [trezor](https://trezor.io),  ledger [nano s](https://www.ledger.com), [coldcard](https://coldcardwallet.com)  

&gt; desktop wallet: [electrum](https://electrum.org/#home), [wasabi](https://wasabiwallet.io)

like a hw wallet?  most recommend hw wallets at around the 0.1 btc mark, but i recommend them pretty much instantly since they serve as the best way to secure passwords, 2fa devices, bitcoin, gpg keys and ssh keys.  but if you don't use passwords, 2fa, gpg or ssh, then 0.1 btc is probably the right time.

&gt; what makes it better than something like coinbase wallet or edge wallet which is what another redditor reccomended.

all redditors are equally wise and full of shit.  you'll need a bit of dyor here.  my love for electrum is based on:

* one of the most widely used wallets out there
* open sourced
* they respond to issues and prs submitted on their github
* they have a good / active subreddit
* it's written in python
* it works on everything but ios (which i don't use)

basically you have a key that breaks down into two exponents that when taken together mod a specific compound number (which is based on two primes) results in the same number.

basically m^pq (mod n) = m

where m is the message, p is the private exponent, q is the public exponent, n is the compound number based on 2 primes.

if you take m^p (mod n) the result will be pseudorandom number c (where c is the ciphertext).

further, c has the property that c^q (mod n) = m because c = m^p (mod n) and thus c^p^q (mod n) = m^p^q (mod n) = m^pq (mod n) = m

&gt; hi there,

we're unable to determine exactly why your bank declined our attempt to validate your card. kindly note that your bank does not provide us with a reason for the decline.

some common reasons why an authorization could fail:

* some banks have restrictions on internet transactions. you may want to check with your credit card company to see if they have such a restriction.
* the billing address included on our site does not match the billing address on your credit card statement.
* amazon is not set up to accept the cvv2 security code associated with credit cards. your bank may be able to temporarily lift this requirement.
* if your bank statement reflects a successful 1.00 usd authorization, a processing issue with your bank may have prevented the authorization from reaching us.
* the authorization is for a low dollar amount (1.00 usd), which your bank may decline",0,0.05281030063859566,crypto_com,jazoom

preface this with: there is no security issue here. the post is incorrect.

this post does not make much sense to me. there is no mail server between the origin and the destination mail server, and there never has been with email.

mail flow for a recovery link to [mail@example.com](mailto:mail@example.com):

[crypto.com](https://crypto.com) \-&gt; mailserver for [example.com](https://example.com) (discovered through [example.com](https://example.com)'s mx dns record)

as you can see, there is no middleman. if the user themselves is using a forwarding service, say [mail@example.com](mailto:mail@example.com) forwards to [mail@gmail.com](mailto:mail@gmail.com), then the [example.com](https://example.com) mailserver will be a middleman, but this is controlled by the user who set up email forwarding, and then entered [mail@example.com](mailto:mail@example.com) as their [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) email address instead of [mail@gmail.com](mailto:mail@gmail.com).

&gt; sorry you’re getting downvoted, but one reason why you might be is because the cryptokitties issue is kind of old news.

sure, it is just one example i quickly put in there to illustrate the point.  it wasn't the only one.  god's unchanged caused network congestion.  a freaking scam (plustoken) brought the network to an absolute grind.  there are several more recent examples.  these are single dapps that are able to negatively impact the entire network on their own.  if we stay like this, it would be a huge loss.

without a doubt.  eth1 is so much better than what is out there.  but what is out there is mostly useless.  also the vision of ethereum is so much more than eth1.  i don't think we disagree here.

&gt; specifically, i’m referring to when he said that businesses currently transact on 30 day timeframes, and anything faster than that is an improvement. so in terms of efficiency, ethereum 1 would be efficient enough

this is what i want to challenge.  we need to do better than eth1.  efficient enough is not good enough.  we need proof of stake.  proof of work is terribly inefficient in so many ways.  there are so many possibilities that will be unlocked with eth2 that are not possible in eth1.  we need to move forward and it's not just nice if we do.  it is a must to realize what ethereum is truly capable of.

one person, which does nothing else than permanently simplifying, with the (obviously needed) catalytic backup of the c-level, especially the ceo.

of course its clear that this will not happen, cardano's mentality cannot accept this (very similar to ethereum/consensys/paritytech mentality).

[https://www.reddit.com/user/lazaridiscom3/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/lazaridiscom3/posts/)

the last ones will be gone once i've extracted any relevant essence.

i'll still lurk a little bit around here, but will focus on those now (max. 1 week per system) :

* **tezos** (strange presentation), **cosmos** (looks nice), some weird stuff from **disney** and others, and finally reaching the ""**elite**"": some **hyperledger** projects.
* **eos2.0** is back on the radar (and they use kingly c++)

i'm sure that within a month, i'll find **the 3 code-bases** which are worth a dive-in.

stuff is kept here (if i don't decide to delete it, too)

anyways.

while the spread of cryptocurrency continues to grow rampantly, the current dapp experience is far from perfect. making a new move, chromia is doing some very unique things in the space, relational blockchain, horizontal scaling with sidechain(s) for each dapp, powerful programming language. chromia would become the most user friendly dapp hosting platform.

essentially, chromia’s goal is to build a platform which offers superior performance for decentralized applications, whilst providing the tools to make development as easy as possible for developers of all backgrounds.

creating a platform that is highly decentralized. each dapp hosted on its platform, is programmed to run on its own blockchain, any mismanagement or overloading of the network of one dapp will remain problematic for that specific chain only, and will not interfere with the wider chromia ecosystem.

quality user experience is the aim of every platform, that's why chromia is designed with the requirements of developers and users explicitly in mind, built to facilitate the creation of genuinely scalable, secure &amp; feature-rich decentralized applications.",0,0.034675319084120075,dapps,tej_owumi

- rollups are not ready. some teams managed to get a custom implementation out the door, but there is no simple generic version yet. optimistic rollups imo don't have good enough properties (ex. 2 weeks to withdraw your token?). zk rollups haven't been made generic yet, and are hard to work with

simple use cases - use neos oracle

complex use cases - use chainlink

explanation:

what you are describing is something more suited to the chainlink decentralized oracle network (staking , crypto-economic incentives etc). neos layer 1 oracle is a simple oracle that fetches data from any public api and publishes the result on-chain to be used once  that's all. as far as i'm aware there's no aggregation or 'error processing', so if the user requires something like that then they need to do it themselves manually in their smart contract or dapp. i think the neo oracle nodes elected to fetch the data may need to reach a bft style consensus on the call for it to be published on-chain (eg &gt; 2/3 of oracle nodes need to have same result), but nothing more than that.

this provides the most basic &amp; accessible oracle (no external token required, just gas) to be used by developers when building on neo. i suspect if they need something more complicated (like what you described), they would go with chainlink when neo integrates to it",0,0.05443028470822239,neo,sketchymunter

3285,2020-04-20 03:07:32,dapp,"it's part of the erc20 standard. 

so if you just send your token to a smart contract, it has no way of knowing you did anything and won't be activated. 

to get around this, erc20 implements the following pattern:

instead of sending your token to a contract, you call a function on the contract and tell it to take tokens from you. it can then do with those tokens as it pleases.

&amp;#x200b;

so for instance, there'll be some uniswap function called taketokens or some such. when you want to send 10 tokens to uniswap, you call taketokens(10) and the smart contract then tells the erc20 standard to transfer 10 tokens from you to it. after which it does all the uniswap magic.

hopefully you can see the security flaw. if you give a contract carte blanche to take tokens from you, why stop at 10? why not just take your whole balance and run to cayman islands?

erc20 advocates a numeric permissioning where you first declare a spendable allowance for a particular contract. you say something like uniswap can only take 10 tokens. then you call uniswaps taketokens(10) and if it tries to take more than 10 the transaction fails and is rolled back.

of course this creates ux friction because you'd have to constantly increase the allowance for every contract you use so most dapp sites ask you to give it an astronomically high allowance so that it can take repeatedly without asking each time. the shorthand for giving an astronomically high allowance is ""unlock"".",0,0.05586733922848015,uniswap,justingoro

virtual games are being developed on the ethereum blockchain, like decentraland, where people can set up virtual properties and businesses that can transact in currency on p2p basis.

what are bitcoin’s special traits that can’t be replicated?

-no central authority to appeal to &lt;- as long as there is the ethereum foundation, and the system is a work in progress, the ef can be appealed to for change that advantage some groups over other.  the system is vulnerable to political influence, which is a type of attack that favours the political animal over the regular user.

-fair distribution - no premine &lt;-this is one of the most important.

-capped issuance.  a system that is open to change is also a system where users are at risk of having their savings inflated away.

-resistant to change - it is a rock that never changes.  like gold.

-not people.  as long as there are people left to make decisions those people will be in a position to pick winners and losers

-hardness - this is very difficult to replicate because it takes a lot of time to create a world wide network of miners bringing so much work to the task

bitcoin is unique amongst its peers for these reasons.  some of these features could be replicated, but they aren't because there is always a centralized group of actors influencing the development to their own benefit.  all of the others have a divide between the users and the developers and the users.  satoshi solved that problem by disapperaing.",0,0.0355064944218594,ethfinance,mcpheeb

let's say for f2pool did, using a timestamp 10 minutes in the future, solve  629,999 but then held onto the block (i.e., not broadcast it).  but then for whatever reason they did share the block privately with antpool who then also was working on 630,000 (while everyone else was still trying to solve 629,999.

then if f2pool gets 630,000 they broadcast both (and likely would have had a message embedded in 630,000 as well).  if antpool gets 630,000, they broadcast f2pool's 629,999 as well as their 630,000.    if either f2pool or antminer detects that some other pool solves 629,999, then both blast out f2pool's 629,999 so as to not have too much hashrate mining to extend the other pool's block.

withholding the block does increase the risk that f2pool's 629,999 would lose permanently, and not be in the ""greatest work"" chain, so i don't see this as being actually what happened.

i do find it odd that nodes got both 629,999 and 630,000 in very rapid succession (a matter of seconds ... well under one minute)?   seriously, the most watched bitcoin block ever in its 11+ years took just 20 seconds to be mined?   possible.  but unlikely.   at the same time, i see ~zero gain from f2pool withholding 629,999, so who knows.",0,0.07876514845742508,bitcoin,cointastical

- split your bsv before sending it anywhere. electrum-sv has something that's intended to do it. it worked last year for me, that's about all i can say about it. since then, i've heard folks complaining it didn't work for them, or that all their money was sent elsewhere. there are malware versions floating around that package electrum-sv with just enough tweaks to screw people over, so check your origins, checksums, etc.

- look at exchanges that touch bsv and pick the one that scares you the least. none of my usual exchanges want to deal with bsv. i end up using gate.io. there may be better ones. or maybe not. i don't know.

- since i was in the fun position of not trusting the exchange where i was sending my coins, i sent them in relatively small batches. one at a time, convert, withdraw, wait for a few confirmations, then and only then send the next batch. so i could not lose more than x% to the exchange suddenly deciding i needed super-extra-kyc to withdraw. in my case, none of that happened, and i got to keep all my loot. yay.

the downside of sending sequential small batches of coins is that volatility can change your numbers a lot. it took me a few days to get done. you'll have to decide if that's worth it for you.

not really; key changes are uncommon; getting things signed - and insight into what's being signed is the main issue.

constructing one just requires a nice ui - like gnosis safe, for example.

&gt;a. keys can move

&gt;b. with approval of the keyholder, key will move within x days, unless rejected by other keys

bittrex, as many of you know, is asking for more detailed info (ssn number, etc) by jan 14th 2020 or you can no longer use them.  i refuse to send them more personal info, so i will be withdrawing all my funds from there and no longer using them.

kucoin has a 2btc withdraw limit per day (unverified) which i'm totally fine with.  that's acceptable.

i have been using abra as my main wallet for the past year, but i want to migrate to a better wallet since there is no way i can withdraw my money in europe from abra. 

also, abra’s technology that fiat and alt coins are tied to bitcoin seems absolutely ridiculous to me.

coinbase seems like an absolute scam - they act like a bank and have your bitcoin in their ‘vault’. i believe this kills the whole idea of cryptocurrency. 

from my research it seems like kraken is the best wallet for europeans (easy withdrawal in fiat).

you dont have a run a node to make a wallet.
making your own wallet is relatively easy, it will provide you with an id and key (password). you can write them down on a piece of paper as a qr code for ex.
then you can use that id and key in myetherwallet (which is actually a missleading name because its a wallet and a node).

those transactions are given to the blockchain via a node. so you can either use a public one or run your own (safer, but honestly hard to run one)

a wallet is just an id and a key, the coins are not literally in the wallet, the coins are registered by the network of computer in the blockchain, and the key is the only way to make them move to another ""wallet id"". 
to do that transaction, you ask the blockchain to make the operation. the thing that does that is a node.

cpp ethereum are open source projects that you can compile yourself to make a wallet and run a node.

etana custody is the banking partner for kraken's usd deposit.

you are making a wire transfer from your account (at your bank) to krakens account (at etana).

wire transfers in america are very slow compared to a sepa transaction in europ.  
 they normally take 3-5 business days (in worst case much longer) and are quite costly.  
 wire transfers are not processed on weekends (except you payed like 50 bugs for express transfer).  
 as you said you are waiting for 6 days, but 2 days are weekend, so you are still within normal waiting time for a wire transfer.  
 

so your money is most likely still on the way from your bank to etana.  
 

and as etana is a rather young/modern banking institute, i’d wager is probably your bank that’s slowing down the process, maybe even on purpose.

i will not dig too much into it but the main advantages are safe sharding with practically unlimited scalability, logging into different websites in 100% decentralized way without need for **any** private information. not even your name is necessary to prove that you are a real human being. another neat thing are airdrops, because it allows the person organizing the airdrop to know that no person will be able to claim it twice- thus making the airdrop amount even higher per person because of decreased risk (check out [fairdrop](https://fairdrop.io)). when the mainnet starts in q3-q4, there will be sharding technology, and later on the messaging app and much, much more.

the kucoin group has received several reports from users that a website is using the kucoin trademark to ask users to transfer digital assets to specific deposit addresses by operating false incentive activity on webpages.

the kucoin group reminds all kucoin users to be extra careful to avoid this type of scam.

bittrex, as many of you know, is asking for more detailed info (ssn number, etc) by jan 14th 2020 or you can no longer use them.  i refuse to send them more personal info, so i will be withdrawing all my funds from there and no longer using them.

kucoin has a 2btc withdraw limit per day (unverified) which i'm totally fine with.  that's acceptable.

so, my question is what other exchanges can u.s. customers use that have no kyc and a ~2btc per day withdraw limit?  what other exchanges are similar to kucoin and legit?  huobi?  binanceus?  bitfinex?  kraken?    i am planning on using a vpn for added security.

i try to use dexs when i can, but often the volumes are such that it's just too annoying. hoping that'll change eventually.

but if had to pick the most trustworthy cexs, thinking purely from the perspective of 'is this exchange going to exit scam or go bankrupt', i'd say binance, coinbase, and (grudgingly) bittrex. i have a small grudge against bittrex for being asshats about kycing legacy accounts, but the exchange itself is trustworthy. i also don't use coinbase much myself so i'm including it more based on conversations with others than personal experience.

so if i got it right, with just one on-chain transaction you practically get unlimited off-chain tps which is awesome.

however, if you aim for global adoption with billions of users, there is not enough space in ~2mb blocks to on-board so many people to level 2 in a reasonable amount of time. the lightning network whitepaper suggests 133mb as a minimum required block size for global adoption, so even if you apply currently planned optimizations it doesn't look like ~2mb can cut it.

so what is the long-term goal here? waiting for a blocksize increase to get consensus, i.e. by increases in cpu speed and bandwidths? or are there other optimizations on the horizon that can enable global adoption of l2 solutions at the current block limit? i was surprised to find that bitcoin core roadmap still has a dynamic blocksize cap in it, is this still being pursued?

then there is no reason for bcn to exist at all, because not a single block mined throughout the entire voting period voted for activating the ifp. all bch miners chose not to vote for ifp, not just jiang, which is transparent evidence through nakamoto consensus that they didn't want to activate ifp and risk a split with bcn.

jiang didn't realize ifp was a bad idea, he realized that a split was possible, and splits are a bad idea, because splits are bad for business. the bsv split was bad for business, and a bcn split would be too.

bitcoin sv - an attack against bitcoin cash, associated with an imposter who claimed to be satoshi nakamoto. he most definitely is not. he was exposed in 2016. this attack vector aimed to attack the ""bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin that can scale on chain"" narrative by claiming that if increasing the block cap was so great, then they'd just unlimitedly increase the block size.

he acted in good faith, to quell un-justified fears about mt. gox being low on fiat reserves. mt. gox had something like 80% of bitcoin's exchange volume at that time, and someone like ver checking their accounts and verifying they were liquid was a useful service. only in hindsight does it look bad, but you of course will not give him that benefit of the doubt. your objective is to smear him, and i suspect that's because he's one of the most determined proponents of cryptocurrency mass-adoption.",0,0.04881627170423358,cryptocurrency,aminok

i've agreed with a lot of the statements you've made.  when applied to bitcoin, they haven't happened. but i've already been willing to accept anything is possible since i started following the space. bitcoin could definitely end up being for the richer in society, but right now, and for the last ten years, it hasnt been. 

i just fail to see your overall point i guess? that bitcoin isn't some all encompassing, magic financial freedom maker? that it's not perfect and also subject to manipulation by the few that hold power over the many?  eh, surprise?

there are a lot of maximalists in the scene, for sure. but many of us are also just quietly enjoying the subtle utilities about it that we cant access elsewhere, and even then, bitcoin isn't our life with our livelihoods dependent on it- although some may act like it is. and if those utilities become inaccessible or not viable anymore, there are plenty of other crypto's to jump too. they may not be as 'secure' as bitcoin as you put it, but they seem to be secure enough. and if a large demographic switches over, including miners, wouldn't that lead to the possibility of eventually equaling if not surpassing that of bitcoins? if that were to happen its assumed what happened to bitcoin would just then repeat with this next one, but humanity seems to have always been in a 'cat n mouse' game of wealth distribution, with the common masses suffering a fat 'l' on their scorecard consistently. for now, bitcoin just seems to be the best option, those who think its perfect are plain silly. 

also are you suggesting these institutions will overtake the operation of mining itself or that these institution will be the first to swoop bitcoin from miners and then hold them over the heads of peasants as the rich consume them like some high end 6 course meal?

my understanding is that since nexo is a custodial account, they have legal custody of the assets.  so theoretically in a ""run on the bank"" situation, nexo, or any other custodial account, could be in the position of not being able to repay individuals after their cash reserves were depleted, just like with cash.

there was also the anarchists dream that was presented on the twitter thing yesterday about paxos where someone said 'if most coins have been through a mixer somewhere in their life then it is fine' which is obviously the wrong approach, but i wonder what happens as it approaches this situation certainly with velocity increasing. you might get paid for a fair service by someone who also earned that bsv for a fair service, but the guy before took coins through what was retrospectively identified as a mixer. as far as chainalysis is concerned, you are now linked to a mixer, though you never even directly interacted with the person or even if you did may not have known. 

i am curious what happens then in the legal side as well as the 'on chain' side. principally it's similar to someone paying you in cash that had previously in its life been used for something illicit, but in this situation we have a direct link via the utxos showing you as using dirty 'bsv' even though you did absolutely nothing wrong, yet suddenly your bsv might be worth less or get you in trouble. do you/anyone have any input on this?",0,0.07533442462420782,bitcoincashsv,martin1209

since totp codes are single use only, you can mitigate this by setting withdrawals or any account changes to be verified with verified again with 2fa and whitelisting withdrawal addresses. these are relatively new features so they might not have been available at the time you got hacked.

i've used gusd before because gemini made it pretty easy to get and redeem, but it's not used as much on exchanges and platforms.

trusttoken requires you to wire money to a hong kong bank in order to make any of their coins, so unless you have free wire transfers, that's a big disadvantage.

pax also requires wire transfers, so until they enable ach, i won't use that one.

i like the concept of dai in that it is decentralized and trustless. but they already had issues keeping the peg which is why they created multi-collateral dai. i guess i'm okay with trusting an entity like coinbase to keep the coins collateralized, but i appreciate what dai brings to the table.

so if you just send your token to a smart contract, it has no way of knowing you did anything and won't be activated. 

to get around this, erc20 implements the following pattern:

instead of sending your token to a contract, you call a function on the contract and tell it to take tokens from you. it can then do with those tokens as it pleases.

&amp;#x200b;

so for instance, there'll be some uniswap function called taketokens or some such. when you want to send 10 tokens to uniswap, you call taketokens(10) and the smart contract then tells the erc20 standard to transfer 10 tokens from you to it. after which it does all the uniswap magic.

hopefully you can see the security flaw. if you give a contract carte blanche to take tokens from you, why stop at 10? why not just take your whole balance and run to cayman islands?

erc20 advocates a numeric permissioning where you first declare a spendable allowance for a particular contract. you say something like uniswap can only take 10 tokens. then you call uniswaps taketokens(10) and if it tries to take more than 10 the transaction fails and is rolled back.

of course this creates ux friction because you'd have to constantly increase the allowance for every contract you use so most dapp sites ask you to give it an astronomically high allowance so that it can take repeatedly without asking each time. the shorthand for giving an astronomically high allowance is ""unlock"".",0,0.05586733922848015,uniswap,justingoro

5136,2020-04-17 23:11:38,uniswap,"&gt;with the knowledge that modifiers are probably the best way to do what i asked, i am still curious as to whether the example would potentially create a reentrancy flaw, since the side effects of the requires are only the reverting of the transaction.  
&gt;  
&gt;not suggesting it as a viable idea, just trying to better understand what is going on under the hood.  
&gt;  
&gt;any thoughts?

the require in your example checks for the msg.sender. this does not directly protect agains reentrancy attacks.

a simple reentrancy attack is an attack where your function calls another function that reenters the first function. for example function a transfers ether. then the fallback function of the receiver can be to call function a. if no checks are implemented the function will send eth again, which would drain the contract. a possible protection is a lock modifier like the new uniswap v2 implementation.

    uint private unlocked = 1;
    modifier lock() {
        require(unlocked == 1, 'uniswapv2: locked');
        unlocked = 0;
        _;                //this executes the logic in your function
        unlocked = 1;     
    }

it is not guaranteed that this protects against all reentrancy. but it protects against the example. because if you receive the ether and call function a (with the lock modifier) again it will not execute (because the first call changes the variable unlocked to 0.

i really appreciate the modularity of it all; one new tool doesn't only serve itself, but can be incorporated as a component in other projects. uniswap and more recently defizap are great examples of this principle. 

it's great to see in a decentralized ecosystem, rather than having one big daddy corporation with a monopoly on all the available services, but the risk is that it can be a house of cards. one flaw can have knock-on effects that could be hard to predict.",0,0.04011129352178809,neo,edgedlt
